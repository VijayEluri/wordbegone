%% The captions to figures and tables are set in a small sans font and are
%% neither named nor numbered, and there is no LoF or LoT. Setting the caption
%% titles in the desired font is simple:

\captiontitlefont{\small\sffamily}%


%% There are two options regarding table and figure captioning: either use the \legend
%% command (which produces an anonymous unnumbered title) instead of the \caption
%% command, or use the \caption command with a modified definition. Just in case the
%% design might change at a later date to required numbered captions, itâ€™s probably best to
%% use a modified version of \caption. In this case this is simple, just give the \caption
%% command the same definition as the \legend command.

\let\caption\legend

%% For fine typesetting you may wish to change the style of particular captions.
%% The default style for a single line caption works well, but for a caption with
%% two or three lines either the centering or centerlastline style might look better.
%% A very long caption is again probably best done in a block paragraph style. Something like:
%%
%%
%%\begin{figure}
%% \captiontitlefont{\small\sffamily}
%% \captionstyle{\centerlastline}
%% ...
%% \legend{...} \label{...}
%% \end{figure}
