we call them, they represent a huge part of the dharma work that needs to be

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&quot;Purification
and accumulation&quot; is the great turn-around, during which past karma is
progressively purified and offloaded, the mind's bad habits become understood

discovered and doors of wisdom start to open as a consequence of changing into
a purer, more-awakened person. </span></p>

that, the meditation journey of the upper stage of the Phase of Accumulation
and, following that, the discovery of voidness in the Phase of Integration,
will be much more singular. For these and other reasons, we will not continue,
in this stage of the course, through all the remaining twenty-nine <i>factors</i>.
However, as purification and accumulation are so common and so important, we
will turn our attention to them a little here and in more detail in our study
of the bodhisattva path.  </span></p>

<h3><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:maroon;
font-weight:normal'>The inter-activity of purification and accumulation</span></i></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>These
two topics are intimately related. What need to be &quot;purified&quot; are the
harmful, painful things we carry within us. Some of these are recognisable and
others are hidden, like time-bombs.  Four main methods of purification are
resorted to<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=FR
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>[3]</span></span></span></a>,
one of them being the antidote &quot;power of practising virtue&quot;. Virtue—in
terms of concrete deeds of body and speech, along with refinement of the mind—is
a vital part of &quot;accumulation&quot;. The other vital part is wisdom and developing
voidness-wisdom is the most powerful aspect of another of the four methods of
purification: the &quot;power of support&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Furthermore,
the elimination of the damaging things automatically creates a space for natural
goodness. It paves the way for natural goodness. Two examples:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>As
     stinginess and fear of personal loss dissolve away, the beauty, simplicity
     and relaxation of generosity can be discovered.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>As
     habits of wounding speech become seen for the harm they do, and as they
     are felt increasingly to be acts unworthy of our minds, then the motivation
     to do something about them grows. Skilful methods are learned and, with
     time and effort, harmful speech habits are eradicated. This process opens
     up, very naturally, a space in which to discover, and then nurture,
     pleasant, meaningful and aware speech.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Moreover,
our lamas tell us that we live in the sixth of the ten 500-year periods of the
Buddha's teaching. It is known as &quot;the time for virtue&quot; and described
as a period in history when the general moral tendency takes a severe downward
turn. Self-centredness, sensual desire and corruption prevail. Therefore, a lot
of counter-current energy is needed even to recognise clearly where life's flow
is taking us. It takes effort to lead a pure and virtuous life. It is said that
in this age, simply to resist the dark and the negative ... is in itself a
strong virtue, equivalent to the great deeds of virtue accomplished in ages
when dharma practice is easier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>As
dawn breaks, the darkness recedes. As rain falls, dryness disappears. With
purification, accumulation automatically increases. Accumulation automatically
purifies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>There
are two ways in which harmful karma from the past can be purified: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>By
     using the skilful methods of the <i>four powers</i> to remove it from
     one's stream of being <i>before</i> it &quot;ripens&quot;. This is like
     removing the seeds of poisonous plants from the soil before they
     germinate.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>By
     living through its consequences.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Thus,
should it be the case that sickness occurs, life circumstances become
difficult, human relationships break down or the like, such events can be seen
as part of purification of karma. When such things happen, it is important to
learn how to shatter the &quot;circle of samsara&quot; and to practise
acceptance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Samsara
is a cyclical or repetitive process. Let us take some examples. Stealing causes
poverty in future lives, poverty leads people to steal ... and so it goes on
and on. Anger and aggression lead to being born in conflict-ridden
circumstances in a future life, these make one angry ... and so it goes on and
on. Sexual misconduct leads to difficult couple relationships and these often
provoke further sexual misconduct... These repetitive processes could go on
interminably. It is vitally important to learn how to be skilful when facing
the maturation of harmful karma, so as not to fall into the trap of old habits,
thereby creating more pain for the future. One helpful factor in developing
such skill is <i>acceptance</i>. The key to this was expressed very clearly by
Santideva:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Whatever can be changed for the better:
change it!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Whatever cannot be changed: accept it!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Thus
Buddhist acceptance does not mean total passivity. It does not mean
&quot;becoming a carpet for other people to walk over&quot;. It means finding
intelligent solutions that are positive and helpful all round and being careful
not to fall into the trap of samsara. When nothing can be done to change the
external circumstances of life, then there is no point compounding the pain by
resent, self-pity, frustration and so forth. Those things just make bad worse.

<h3><i><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:maroon;font-weight:
normal'>The significance of the term &quot;sangha&quot;</span></i></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";background:
transparent'>Just as <i>Buddha</i> simply means <i>awakened one</i> and <i>dharma</i>
means <i>things</i>, so does <i>sangha</i> simply mean &quot;the
community&quot;. However, although this term could theoretically include all Buddhists,
its meaning has been precisely used for over two thousand years to refer to something
quite specific:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";background:
transparent'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";background:
     transparent'>Either a certain type of monastic gathering, in this world,
     or </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";background:
     transparent'>Deeply-realised beings (<i>arya</i>), in the vast expanse of
     mind. </span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";
background:transparent'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";background:
transparent'>Since the sangha is one of the Three Jewels, i.e. the Refuges (see
below), the term has to refer to something worthy of being a refuge.</span><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'> Hence the loose usage that has developed
recently in the West, with people referring to the members of their local
Buddhist group as <i>our sangha</i>, is correct only etymologically but not traditionally,
unless of course the local members are all so liberated that they rank
alongside the Buddha and the dharma as refuges (I have yet to find such a
centre!). Our contemporary masters, such as the Tai Situpa, have made it clear
that it is better to refer to our local communities as precisely that—<i>my
local Buddhist community, the members of our centre</i>—and to keep the term <i>sangha</i>
in its traditional use.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>    What then
is the traditional definition? First, it refers to a gathering of monastics. In
this case, the qualification for the title <i>sangha</i> varies, according to
the circumstances, depending upon whether a sangha needs to be constituted to
give a refuge ceremony, to give lay vows, to give novice vows or full ordination
but in general we can follow Jé Gampopa's definition of <i>any gathering of
more than four fully-ordained monastics who have properly maintained their vows</i>.
For the ceremonies, there also often needs to be an abbot<a href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=FR style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Palatino Linotype"'>[6]</span></span></span></a> who has maintained full ordination
purely for at least ten years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>    The
celestial (for want of a better term) or <i>realised</i> sangha consists of
those who have attained the four degrees of realisation (stream entrant,
non-returner, once-returner and arhat, particularly the latter) in the Hinayana
and the bodhisattvas who have transcended rebirth and abide in the ten levels,
for the Mahayana.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The sangha are
known as &quot;our true friends on the path&quot; and this explains the above.
In the case of the worldly sangha, there is a large enough gathering of
experienced monastics to transcend individuality and to represent the sangha as
a whole. In the case of the realised sangha, it is their clear, stable and
non-regressing insight that qualifies them to teach and be unbiased
&quot;friends&quot; for beings. </span></p>

disciples around the Buddha during his lifetime—some with spectacular stories,
such as Angulimala<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=FR

there were hundreds who became arhats. During the forty-five years of his
teaching and of the development of the Buddhist community around his presence,
hundreds of thousands of people became sangha members or supporters and the
sangha had the time to become strong and stable. It had the time for its
natural leaders to emerge. Their realisation was confirmed beyond any doubt by
the Buddha himself. We are so fortunate to have a founding figure who taught
for so long and who had plenty of time to form an enlightened community around
him that was sure of his message and able to perpetuate it through time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>In the Jataka
tales, which recount the former lives of the Buddha as a bodhisattva, Ananda
was often the bodhisattva's brother. Born in the Buddha's final existence as
his cousin<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span

with the Buddha, serving him most devotedly. Thanks to this, he could act as
arbiter after the Buddha's passing, deciding which accounts of the sutras given
by the arhats were the most correct. He had total recall. </span>Nyanaponika
Thera says:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

0cm;margin-left:27.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Ananda had this
ability to a phenomenal degree. He could immediately remember everything, even
if he had heard it only once. He could repeat discourses of the Buddha
flawlessly up to 60,000 words, without leaving out a single syllable. He was
able to recite 15,000 four-line stanzas of the Buddha.</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>It is hard to
find the correct term to describe Ananda's role; perhaps &quot;right hand
man&quot; would be our choice these days. Nyanaponika Thera says the following:</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:39.6pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt;margin-left:
27.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The term &quot;attendant&quot; is actually not
comprehensive enough. There is hardly an English word, which can do full justice
to his position. If we were to choose designations such as
&quot;secretary&quot; or &quot;adjunct,&quot; then we would not express the
most intimate aspects of his attendance, extending to many little items of
personal assistance given to the Master. If we called him a
&quot;servant,&quot; then we would omit the organizational and directing
aspects, which manifested on many occasions. And if we looked for examples in
the world's literature of a confidante of a great man, who accompanied him
constantly, we would not find his likeness.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:39.6pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt;margin-left:
27.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>This loving attention for 25 years consisted of the
following services: Ananda brought water for washing to the Buddha and
tooth-wood, he arranged his seat, washed his feet, massaged his back, fanned
him for coolness, swept his cell, and mended his robes. He slept nearby at
night to be always on hand. He accompanied him on his rounds through the
monastery (Mv VIII.16)<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=FR
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[10]</span></span></span></a>
and after meetings he checked to see whether any monk had left anything behind.
He carried the Buddha's messages (Cv V.20) and called the monks together, even
sometimes at midnight (J 148). When the Buddha was sick, he obtained medicine
for him. Once when monks neglected a very sick fellow monk, the Buddha and
Ananda washed him and together carried him to a resting-place (Mv VIII.26). In
this way Ananda performed the many daily tasks and cared for the physical
well-being of his enlightened cousin like a good mother or a caring wife.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:39.6pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt;margin-left:
35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB>But above all, he also had the duties of a good general
secretary, namely the smooth communication between the thousands of monks and

community.</span></p>

sangha. He also made it possible for women to become nuns, something quite
novel for the time.</span><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'> He was
naturally humble and totally focused on the Buddha. This even caused one monk,
Udayi, to say that he should spend less time devotedly serving the Buddha and
more time working on his own liberation. The Buddha rebuked Udayi for this and prophesied
Ananda's liberation:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

be king of the gods seven times because of the purity of his heart, or be king

liberation in this very life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";background:

interlocutor of the Buddha and the one to whom the Buddha addresses key
remarks. The Buddha praised him and his skill with the sangha on many occasions
(sometimes also reminding him of the thin veils remaining to be removed within
him!) and in one Jataka tells how he was previously his servant, accumulating
great merit. He again predicted his liberation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>In fact, due
to his relentless service, Ananda did not achieve the arhat state during the
Buddha's life. This lack of attainment almost prevented him from joining the
council of five hundred arhats<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>That Council
actually put Ananda on trial first, over three relatively minor matters and one
more important, namely saying that on three occasions the Buddha had given him
(albeit subtly) indications of his (the Buddha's) imminent passing and that
Ananda could, on those occasions , have successfully petitioned the Buddha to
remain on Earth for an aeon. By the time Ananda realised the Buddha's passing
was imminent, it was too late to make such a petition. The sangha accused
Ananda of lack of awareness and vigilance in this matter. Ananda's defense against
this and the other three accusations was at all times impeccable and reasonable
and he was acquitted, becoming a great leader of the sangha, second only to
Maha Kasyapa.</span></p>

their Brahmin teachers and left their huge followings to seek &quot;the deathless
state&quot;, wandering far and wide. Unsuccessful, they eventually returned to
their native Rajgir and decided to meditate apart: the first one to find the
deathless state would then inform the other. </span></p>

met Assaji (one of the Buddha's first five monks) who was now an arhat. Just

him to become, there and then, a stream-entrant<a href="#_ftn14"

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:39.6pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt;margin-left:
35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Once when the Venerable Sariputta was living with the
Elder Maha Moggallana at Kapotakandara, he was sitting meditating in the open
with his hair freshly shaved when he was given a malicious blow on the head by
a mischievous spirit. The blow was a very severe one, but at the time it was
given &quot;the Elder was absorbed in meditative attainment; consequently he
suffered no harm.&quot; The source of this story is the Udana (IV.4) which
continues the account as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:39.6pt;margin-bottom:

Maha Moggallana saw the incident and approached the Venerable Sariputta to ask
how he fared. He asked him: &quot;Brother, are you comfortable? Are you doing
well? Does nothing trouble you?&quot; </span></p>

the Venerable Sariputta. &quot;I am doing well, brother Moggallana. Only my

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:39.6pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt;margin-left:
35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Whereupon the Venerable Maha Moggallana said: &quot;O
wonderful is it, brother Sariputta! O marvelous is it, brother Sariputta! How
great is the psychic power, and how great is the might of the Venerable
Sariputta! For just now, brother Sariputta, a certain demon gave you a blow on
the head. And a mighty blow it was! With such a blow one might fell an elephant
seven or seven and a half cubits high, or one might split a mountain peak. But
the Venerable Sariputta says only this, 'I am comfortable, brother Moggallana.
I am doing well, brother Moggallana. Only my head troubles me a little.'&quot;</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:39.6pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt;margin-left:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Maudgalyana had also the qualities of
kindness, equanimity and justice that his brother Elder, Sariputra, possessed
as well as great teaching ability. He often shared a monastic cell with
Sariputra and important teachings, later to become doctrine, were given by them
in conversation with the bhikkhus who came to them for instruction. </span></p>

conversation with the Buddha, even when the latter was many kilometres away,
through the power known as &quot;divine ear&quot;. He could also perform miracles:
once the Buddha asked him to perform one to inspire the sangha to practice. He
shook the vihara (dharma dwelling) by placing his big toe against the wall and
causing an earth tremor. The Buddha told the community that Maudgalyana's
powers came from his mastery of the dhyana meditations. He could also see
other's minds clearly, as the following story tells:</span></p>

day, the Buddha sat silently throughout the whole night in front of the
assembly of monks. When the morning dawned, he only said: &quot;This assembly
is impure.&quot; Thereupon Moggallana surveyed with his mind the entire
assembly from monk to monk and saw that one monk was entirely corrupted. He
went towards him and asked him to leave. When that monk did not move though
asked thrice, Moggallana took him by the arm, led him out of the hall and
bolted the door. Then he begged the Exalted One to recite the Rules of Monastic
Discipline (Patimokkha), as the assembly was now pure again.</span></p>

great clairvoyant powers led him to tell many stories of beings in other
dimensions, describing their joys and sufferings and thereby confirming the
Buddha's teachings on karma and reincarnation, since many of the beings he met
in other realms could recall their former lives and the specific deeds that had
caused them to be reborn as they were.</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:

and more people left their local gurus to join the sangha:</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:39.6pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt;margin-left:

were so enraged about that loss of public esteem and support that they wanted
to get rid of Moggallana. Without investigating the causes in themselves, they
projected blame externally and concentrated their envy and hate on
Maha-Moggallana. Hesitating to commit a murder themselves, some evil-minded
Jains hired such a gang and ordered them to kill Moggallana.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:39.6pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt;margin-left:
35.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB>At that time, Maha-Moggallana lived alone in a forest
hut at Kalasila. After his encounter with Mara he knew that the end of his days
was near. Having enjoyed the bliss of liberation, he now felt the body to be
just an obstruction and burden. Hence he had no desire to make use of his
faculties and keep the body alive for the rest of the aeon. Yet, when he saw
the brigands approaching, he just absented himself by using his supernormal
powers. The gangsters arrived at an empty hut, and though they searched
everywhere, could not find him. They left disappointed, but returned on the
following day. On six consecutive days Moggallana escaped from them in the same
way. His motivation was not the protection of his own body, but saving the
brigands from the fearsome karmic consequences of such a murderous deed,
necessarily leading to rebirth in the hells. He wanted to spare them such a
fate by giving them time to reconsider and abstain from their crime. But their
greed for the promised money was so great that they persisted and returned even
on the seventh day. Then their persistence was &quot;rewarded,&quot; for on
that seventh day Moggallana suddenly lost the magic control over his body. A
heinous deed committed in lives long past (by causing the death of his own
parents) had not yet been expiated, and the ripening of that old Kamma
confronted him now, just as others are suddenly confronted by a grave illness.
Moggallana realized that he was now unable to escape. The brigands entered,
knocked him down, smashed all his limbs and left him lying in his blood. Being
keen on quickly getting their reward and also somewhat ill as ease about their
dastardly deed, the brigands left at once, without a further look.</span></p>

was such that his vital energies had not yet succumbed. He regained
consciousness and was able to drag himself to the Buddha. There, in the
Master's presence, at the holiest place of the world, at the source of the
deepest peace, Moggallana breathed his last (Jat. 522E). </span></p>

the Buddha. He features in nineteen of the Jataka stories, six times being the
future Buddha's father. We have no certainty of his age, either upon meeting
the Buddha or when he died. Legend tells us that he was born a Brahmin son of a
minor monarch of Magadha. He had an innate tendency to reclusion and meditation
and did not want to marry. When pushed towards marriage by his parents, he made
a clothed statue in the likeness of the only woman he could marry and set them
the task of finding someone just like that. They did, eventually. She was
Bhadra Kapilani (see below), who had been linked with him for many previous
lives. She too was innately religious and did not want to marry but, due to
subterfuges by both sets of parents, they were eventually wed but lived in
celibacy, placing a garland of flowers between them in bed and resisting any
corporeal temptation, delighted to do so. Eventually, they both left the tiny
kingdom, with shaven heads and yellow robes, as was the custom for wandering
ascetics. After a while, to avoid gossip, their ways separated and they each
found the Buddha. The earth shook slightly when they parted and, on feeling the
tremor, the Buddha actually went to meet Kasyapa.</span></p>

robes with the Buddha and it was he who was signalled by the Buddha as equal in
teaching authority. Some say that the Buddha did this in the knowledge that
Sariputra and Maudgalyana would pass away before him. Kasyapa's strength was in
his practice rather than in his teaching skill. <span style='background:transparent'>He
was always reluctant to teach, even when asked to do so by the Buddha, and had
few personal students. He preferred retreat and meditation, setting a fine
example in the latter.</span> The Buddha's trust in him was total:</span></p>

praise given him by the Buddha, may be found in a sutta where it is said that
Maha Kassapa could attain at will, just like the Buddha himself, the four
fine-material and the four immaterial meditative absorptions, the cessation of
perception and feeling, and could also attain the six supernormal knowledges <i>(abhinna),</i>
which include the supernormal powers and culminate in the attainment of Nibbana
(S.16:9). Here his powerful meditative achievements, equalling those of the
Buddha, appear as a characteristic trait of Maha Kassapa's mind. It was because
of that deep meditative calm that he could adapt himself, unperturbed, to all
external situations and live as one of few wants, materially and socially.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Most people know that, and understand
why, most Buddhist history, as most history in general, is male-predominated.
Even so, Buddhism has a very good record for allowing women to become
monastics, recluses and dharma teachers and this since the time of Buddha
himself. Most reasons for the male dominance are to do not so much with
religion but with social mores of the epochs and countries involved. A
distinction needs to be made between the &quot;glass ceilings&quot; of
organisational position and the unlimited possibilities of spiritual progress,
the latter being the main point of dharma. It is certain that the deeper
teachings (the fourteen root tantric precepts, for instance) make any feeling
of male superiority clearly a failing. It is also clear that the states that we
are aiming to achieve (arhat, arhani, bodhisattva, bodhisattvi, mahasiddha,
mahasiddhi and so forth) rely, in the most part, upon transcending both the
physical and mental aspects of sexuality to attain something far more sublime
and enlightened. One is aiming for a pure mind and the basic teachings on that
pure mind—as buddha nature—say that &quot;dharmata knows no differences of
male, female, caste, race or the like&quot;. </span></p>

the Kalahavivāda Sutta, and five hundred young Sakyan men joined the Order. The
Sakyan wives, led by Prajāpatī, went to the Buddha and asked leave to also be
ordained. The Buddha refused and went on to Vesāli. But Prajāpatī and her
companions, undaunted, had barbers cut off their hair, and donning yellow
robes, followed the Buddha to Vesāli on foot. They arrived with wounded feet at
the Buddha's monastery and repeated their request to ordain as monastics. The
Buddha again refused but Ananda interceded on their behalf and Buddha granted
their request, subject to eight strict conditions.</span></p>

attributed to the third or fourth century CE. </span><span lang=EN-GB
style='background:transparent'>He </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:
"Palatino Linotype";background:transparent'>was born in the region of Kashmir.
He had been predicted by Buddha Shakyamuni, who announced that about nine
centuries after his parinirvana, Asanga would appear in this world <strong><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";font-weight:normal'>to protect the
teachings of the Mahayana</span></strong><b>.</b> His younger brother was <strong><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Vasubandhu</span></strong>. Their
mother, Prasannasila, a former nun, had made the powerful vow to give birth to
two sons whom she would rear to help spread and strengthen the teachings of the
Buddha, following a period of decline after the destruction of a great part of
the library of Nalanda by arson.</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:
"Palatino Linotype"'><br>
<br>
Asanga took monastic vows, studied the tripitaka and the Mahayana, and pursued
his search for a definite understanding of ultimate reality by entering the
path of the tantras. During an initiation, Asanga's cast flower fell on the
field of Buddha Maitreya. Consequently, Asanga<strong><span style='font-family:
"Palatino Linotype"'> </span></strong><strong><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";
font-weight:normal'>meditated on future Buddha Maitreya</span></strong>. He
journeyed to the mountain called Bird Foot Hill and meditated in seclusion.<br>
    After three years without result, he felt despondent and left his cave. On
his way he saw a pigeon leaving its nest through a small hole in the rocks.
Noticing how that hole had been worn smooth by the feathers of generations of
pigeons, Asanga was inspired to more diligence and returned to his practice.
After three more years of fruitless meditation, he again felt like giving up.
On his way to town he met a man who was rubbing an iron bar with a smooth
cloth. Upon asking the man what he was doing, he was told that he was making a
needle! So much diligence for such a small worldly aim encouraged Asanga to
return to his retreat place once more. A third time that he left, he saw a man
digging away a mountain, that cast shade on his cottage.<br>
    <strong><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";font-weight:normal'>After
12 years</span></strong> of meditation, he still had not &quot;met&quot;
Maitreya face-to-face. Desperate and discouraged, he again left his retreat
place and on the way to the next town, he passed a sick old dog on the side of
the street. The dog's hind part was paralysed and eaten by worms. Although the animal
was aggressive towards him, Asanga only felt overwhelming compassion. He
thought of removing the worms, but realized that his fingers would squeeze some
of them to death. Therefore he decided to remove them with his tongue. He knelt
down, closed his eyes, unable to bear the sight and smell of the dog's festering
sores, lowered his head and ... touched the dusty ground. He opened his eyes and
<strong><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";font-weight:normal'>saw
Maitreya in front of him</span></strong><b>. </b><br>
    Asanga, surprised, asked him why he hadn't appeared earlier. Maitreya
answered:</span></p>

one was able to see Maitreya, only a pious old woman perceived part of a dead
dog on Asanga's shoulder. <span style='background:transparent'>And so Asanga
understood what it meant to be veiled by mental obscurations: without great
compassion and understanding, karmic obscurations cannot be dispelled.<br>
    Asanga's perception was now purified, and he experienced the pure dimension
of Tushita, the paradise of Maitreya. There he received the <i>Five Great
Treatises of Maitreya</i>.&nbsp;Returning with them to our world, he taught
them widely.</span> His brother <b>Vasubandhu</b> had, in the meantime, become
a great scholar and teacher of Hinayana abhidharma. Under Asanga, he entered
the Mahayana and became the main commentator on his brother's works. Asanga
also authored important Mahayana texts in his own right (see <a
href="#mahatexts">Annexe</a>). The influence of these two brothers was enormous
and it lasts until today.</span></p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:maroon;
background:transparent'>Aryadeva</span></b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:
"Palatino Linotype";background:transparent'> was born in Sri Lanka to a royal
family, and lived between the middle of the second and the middle of the third
centuries C.E. According to some accounts, he was born from a lotus. At an
early age, he became a monk and studied the Buddhist scriptures, the <em><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Tripitaka</span></em>, thoroughly there
before leaving to South India to study with Nagarjuna</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'> in the Shatavahana kingdom of King
Udayibhadra. King Udayibhadra was the recipient of Nagarjuna’s famous <em><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Letter to a Friend</span></em> and <em><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Precious Garland</span></em>. Aryadeva
accompanied Nagarjuna and continued to study with him at Shri Parvata, the holy
mountains overlooking modern-day Nagarjunakonda Valley in Andhra Pradesh.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>At that time,
Matrcheta, a devotee of Shiva, was defeating everyone at Nalanda in debate.
Aryadeva went to meet the challenge. Aryadeva defeated Matrcheta in both debate
and miraculous powers and, after that, Matrcheta became his disciple, changing
his name to <b>Ashvaghosha</b>. The latter went on to write <em><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Fifty Verses on the Guru</span></em>,
the standard text for how disciples need to relate to a tantric master. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Aryadeva stayed at
Nalanda for many years. Later in life, however, he returned to Nagarjuna, who
entrusted all his teachings to him before he passed away. Aryadeva built many
monasteries in that area of southern India and taught extensively, establishing
the Mahayana tradition and, in particular, the Madhyamaka tenets. He is famous
for composing the <em><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Four
Hundred Verse Treatise on the Actions of a Bodhisattva’s Yoga</span></em> . It is
known as <em><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The Four Hundred</span></em>
for short. Like Nagarjuna, Aryadeva too wrote commentaries on the <em><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Guhyasamaja Tantra</span></em>. Before
passing away, Aryadeva entrusted the teachings to Rahulabhadra.</span></p>

<p style='background:#CCFFFF'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>A
split developed in the line of Aryadeva, between the followers of his
commentators Buddhapalita and Bhavaviveka. The former gave rise to the <i>Prasangika</i>
or Consequence Middle Way School and the latter to the <i>Svatantra</i> or
Autonomy Middle Way School.</span></p>

<p style='background:#CCFFFF'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";
color:maroon'>Chandrakirti</span></b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>
was in the next generation of disciples after Rahulabhadra. He wrote the most
famous Indian commentary on <em><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
Four Hundred</span></em> and vigorously defended the stance of Buddhapalita and
therefore gave rise to the Consequence School. His texts on the Middle Way and
logic are great classics, very influential in Tibetan Buddhism.</span></p>

<h5><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:maroon;

style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";background:transparent'> was one of the
most important figures in the development of Mahayana Buddhism in India. He is seen
by some later Buddhists as cofounder of the Yogacara school along with his half
brother Asanga.</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>
At first he studied in the Sarvastivardin tradition but became dissatisfied
with the abhidharma explanations of the famous Great Commentary. He himself wrote
commentaries on many sutras, works on logic, devotional poetry, works on
Abhidharma classifications, as well as original and innovative philosophical
treatises. <span style='background:transparent'>His &quot;Treasury of
Abhidharma&quot; <i>Abhidharmakosha</i> and his commentary to same (<i>Abhidharmakoshabhāshya</i>)
became great classics, both summarising and criticising the Great Commentary

of his writings have survived in their original Sanskrit form, but many others,
particularly his commentaries, are extant only in their Chinese or Tibetan
translations. Vasubandhu was a many-sided thinker, and his personality as it
emerges from his works and his biographies shows him as a man who was not only
a great genius and a philosopher, but also a human being who was filled with
great compassion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>He
later converted to Mahayana and composed many other voluminous treatises,
especially on Yogacara doctrines. Most influential in Eastern Asia was probably
the <i>Trimśikā</i>, the Thirty Verses on the Merely Representative and its
companion <i>Vimśatikā</i>, but he also wrote a large number of other works. At
first, he found his brother's works unnecessarily complex and not at all to his
taste. He was not very complimentary about them. Asanga very skilfully feigned
serious illness and Vasubandhu met with him, for the first time in a long time.
As soon as they started speaking about dharma, Vasubandhu recognised the superiority
of his brother's realisation and system. So much so, he wanted to cut off his
own tongue for having denigrated him and it ... but Asanga told him it would be
better to use his tongue for dharma. His commentaries to Asanga's texts and
thinking give us a wealth of insight.</span></p>

Indian Buddhist philosopher and logician <span style='color:maroon'>Dignaga</span>
(A.D. 480-540), was a disciple of Vasubandhu. He laid the foundations for the
Buddhist teachings on cognition theory and logic. It is said that he had
composed some 108 papers on logic and then saw the need to distil them all into
one text. The result, his Compendium of the Means of True Knowledge (<i>pramanasamuccaya</i>)
is one of the greatest works on Buddhist logic, yet it is very dense and not
easy to follow.</span></p>

whose Seven Treatises on Valid Cognition develop Dignaga's works have given us
some our most masterly and useful texts on logic. </span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>He was born a Brahmin in the south of
India and, a remarkably intelligent child, went to study in central India,
where he mastered much of both Buddhist and Advaita philosophy. In particular
he studied under a disciple of Dignaga. He saw how close, in many ways, were
the theories of Dignaga and Advaita. Being as well-informed about Buddhist
philosophy as anyone could be, and, knowing that only a master of both
disciplines could truly judge any differences, he returned to the South, where
he studied for twelve years under the greatest Advaita teachers. He also
received Buddhist transmission of the Chakrasamvara Tantra and had what is
known as a face-to-face meeting with Chakrasamvara. He saw the subtle flaws in
Advaita philosophy and now possessed both the knowledge and the spiritual power
to match anyone in debate. His influence in India became enormous and he
brought many people to dharma. He is seen as an earlier incarnation of the Karmapas
and the Seventh Karmapa has particularly strong visions of him and composed
major treatises on his work, dictating huge passages to his secretary and
citing the original verbatim without ever needing to refer to the original
texts.</span></p>

was a great spiritual master, said to have attained the third bodhisattva level
and to have been a &quot;disciple of Vasubandhu&quot;. Perhaps this means he
was of the line of Vasubandhu, as some people date him in the 7th century CE.
He composed a famous text called <i>Root Text on the Vinaya</i> as well as
various commentaries to it, such as the <i>Twelve Thousand Verses</i>. </span></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>To take Refuge is to
recognise that all alone, relying on one's own wits and judgement, one will
never gain total freedom nor will one fulfil one's life by awakening all
possible human qualities to the full. To take refuge is a recognition that
countless beings in the past <i>have</i> achieved freedom and fulfilment by
travelling &quot;the one and only way&quot; taught by the most liberated,
wisest, kindest and compassionate being ever to grace this planet—the Buddha.
It is an understanding that no one, even Buddha, can just save us but that each
person needs to attain to freedom and wisdom by their own efforts. Thus <b>the
Buddha</b> is seen not as a saviour but as the <b>Teacher</b> and example.  That
work is achieved by the methods and counsel of <b>the dharma—as the teaching
and the path</b>. The living experience of the dharma teachings is maintained
by <b>the sangha-our companions on the path</b>.</span></p>

refuge, and then strengthening the refuge by re-confirming it every day—many
times a day—gives great strength to the mind. Indecision is by its very nature
something that saps strength. Although intelligent questioning has its place,
so also does conviction and determination. A mind that has decided where it is
going and is content with its choices is a happy mind and a strong mind. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span lang=EN-GB

dharma and the sangha. These are known in Sanskrit as the <i>triratna</i>, the <i>Three

refuge are that:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span lang=EN-GB
     style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The <b>historical Buddha </b>did
     achieve total liberation and total wisdom. He became those things and his
     protective, guiding power shines throughout the five thousand years his
     teachings remain in this world. Moreover, we have seen that Sakyamuni
     became the <b>three kayas</b>—the very embodiment of wisdom, compassion,
     freedom, purity and power to help others. The kayas are the eternal buddha
     and lasting refuge. Furthermore, since we all have the <b>buddha nature</b>
     as our true nature, we have the very essence of those three kayas within
     our very own mind. Everyone can attain to it. Each of these three aspects
     of buddha (historical being, kayas and buddha nature) is a worthy refuge.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span lang=EN-GB
     style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The dharma is the tried-and-tested
     collection of universal truths that have provided the means for hundreds
     of millions of beings to work towards liberation of the mind. The Buddha
     cannot simply &quot;save&quot; us by his blessing [if that were the case
     we would have been saved aeons ago] but by teaching us how to follow this
     age-old way that he and everyone who became buddhas have followed. The
     dharma has a remarkable quality of total purity.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span lang=EN-GB
     style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Transmission of those dharma
     teachings is a living thing, from human to human: simply reading the words
     and the methods in books will never provide enough for liberation to
     happen. The sangha, and especially the <i>realised sangha</i>, carry the
     inner light of dharma. They have stable realisation of its result and that
     serves as the basis for transmission of knowledge.  </span></li>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span lang=EN-GB

as the <b>Teacher</b>, in the <b>dharma</b> as the <b>teachings</b> showing the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>    The main <b>motivation</b> for
taking refuge comes from a recognition of the sufferings and dangers of samsara

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>    The <b>duration</b> for which one
takes refuge is from the moment of the ceremony until death. In very early
times, any Buddhist could give refuge to another. The ceremony is taken before
representations of the Three Precious Refuges: an image of the Buddha, the
dharma texts and a gathering of the sangha headed by a senior monk. Refuge is
received by reciting the following formula three times after the preceptor:</span></p>

I, ... by name, take my refuge from now until I die, in the Buddha, the most
sublime of all humans, in the dharma, the most sublime of all that transcends
desire, and in the sangha, the most sublime of communities.</span></p>

knee) with the hands folded at the heart. A small lock of hair is cut, in
remembrance of the Buddha cutting his hair when he left the palace, as a symbol
of leaving vanity, ignorance and worldliness. A dharma name is given as a token
of being &quot;reborn&quot; into a new phase of life. Sometimes water is
sprinkled on the head as well.</span></p>

(basic and Mahayana), a person takes refuge in the Three Precious Refuges and
becomes a Buddhist. That is all. It is like entering the great gate into
dharma. One is <u>not</u> taking refuge in that particular Buddhist lineage or
in the particular Buddhist master who gives the ceremony. Of course, there is
inevitably some connection but that is only incidental. No commitment whatsoever
has been taken to follow that teacher or that tradition. The choice of
tradition and teacher is another matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>   Another point that often comes up is the
question, &quot;Can I take refuge a second time?&quot; The answer is nearly
always <i>yes</i>, since once refuge has been taken it is renewed every day
anyway, and so participating in a second or third ceremony can be seen as a way
of refreshing or renewing the refuge commitment. However, when this is the
case, one only repeats the promise three times, along with everyone else, but
does not go forward for the hair-cutting or new name.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Some
people cannot see the point of taking a formal commitment of refuge, through a
ceremony. They feel that the inner trust they feel for the Buddha and his
teachings is enough. <span style='background:transparent'>However, the
traditional teachings say that there is unimaginable benefit in going through
the ceremony, because it establishes a <i>root of virtue</i>. A root of virtue
is something that produces goodness non-stop, whether one is asleep or awake,
actually performing virtue or not. It is called &quot;root&quot; because it is
like planting a tree, which grows stronger each year, producing more and more
branches and fruits. </span>Without a root of virtue, good karma is only
generated in the actual moments of virtuous mind and action. In the case of
refuge, virtue would only be generated in those moments, those seconds, when
the heart is in a state of trust and devotion to the Three Precious Refuges. Whereas
from the time of the refuge ceremony onwards (unless the commitment is broken
or handed back), <i>every</i> moment is generating good refuge karma. This all
happens because of the way a profound commitment changes the entire mind—in
other words, the entire person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>   
The <i>root of virtue</i> of refuge can only be properly planted through the
circumstances of the ceremony, during which a very special interdependence
occurs as the aspirant's mind opens up and takes a promise in the presence of
what can respond to that commitment and promise. </span></p>

the second of the <i>particular</i> instructions above, it says that a natural
consequence of taking refuge in the dharma is to do one's best never to harm
any sentient being ((including oneself!). This is the very heart of dharma—the
&quot;Path of Peace&quot;, &quot;The Way of No-Harm&quot; (<i>ahimsa</i>). Therefore,
the natural consequence of refuge is to take at least one of the precepts that
avoid harm. Such commitments are known as the <i>individual-liberation</i>
commitments / vows / precepts. The Sanskrit word is <i>pr</i></span><i>ā</i><i><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>timoksha</span></i><span

when taking refuge but many masters counsel it and many &quot;refugees&quot;
like to take advantage of this special moment in their life to make such a
sacred promise. At Samye Ling, people taking refuge are requested to observe
the five main lay precepts ( see below) for the twenty-four hours following the
ceremony.</span></p>

<i>vows of individual liberation</i> are so-called because they help free a
person from the shackles of karma. They are focused on actions of body and
speech. By not harming others, physically or verbally, a person is not only
making the world a more peaceful and harmonious place but also, at the same
time, not creating for himself or herself harmful karma that will rebound back
in a future life, as described in the karma teachings. The &quot;rebound&quot;
can be a lower type of rebirth, painful circumstances even if one is human or
an unhealthy, unpleasant environment. Furthermore, by thoroughly establishing
habits of non-harm and saying a definitive &quot;goodbye&quot; to old, harmful
habits, one is closing the door on what might have become an incalculable
number of harms in future lives. A brighter future is opened up.</span></p>

saw, in the refuge teachings, that a vow plants a <i>root of virtue</i> that
works non-stop from the moment of taking it onwards, until it is broken or
given up or expires. It is dramatically different from the moment-by-moment
karma of ordinary life. Therefore, there is untold benefit in keeping precepts
and this is why Tibetan lamas are so keen on us taking them, provided that we
are ready and able to keep them. That's another kettle of fish!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
first four of these Five Great Gifts were already discussed in the karma
chapter. The fifth—not to take intoxicants—refers to any intake of drugs or
alcohol that alters consciousness and thereby diminishes good judgement. Those
who take this precept are allowed prescribed medications, even if those do
affect consciousness, assuming there is some overall benefit in taking them. It
precludes leisure drugs, especially habit-forming ones, including alcohol and tobacco.
The main point of not taking intoxicants is that the blurred judgement and
dependency they lead to can then cause a person to commit other harmful
actions. But there is also the fact that they harm the precious human existence
of the person taking them. In this respect, Tibetan lamas say that most people
severely underestimate the harm caused by smoking. Although Buddha Sakyamuni
never pronounced on smoking (it seems to have reached India after his time),
Guru Rinpoche speaks of it several times in the <i>terma<a href="#_ftn45"
name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

the 8th century CE and discovered at various moments of history since then. He
describes it as an agent, a vector, for bringing negative influences into the <i>prana</i>
systems of the body. When one considers the sacredness of breath in many
faiths, and its use in advanced yogas—both physical and mental—it is not
surprising that polluting the breath-system with smoke and poisons,
&quot;blessed by demons&quot;, is seen as a horrible and damaging thing to do!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
five groups of monastic precepts are a little more complicated and will be
explained in brief here. They developed at the time of the Buddha but, except
for the basics, he never laid them down as his own idea of an ideal set of
rules for the sangha to follow. Each rule arose out of an incident, due to
which the sangha members were not sure what to do—or not—in a certain situation
and so they requested his counsel. This accounts for the rather heterogeneous
nature of the rules and their great number. Had the Buddha lived another eighty
years, there would doubtless have been a good deal more, as different
situations arose. Thus there is the spirit and the letter of the monastic code.
Often these coincide but sometimes not. Taken as a whole, the rules exist
primarily to keep a monastic's life simple and to free up time for practice.
Thus begging for food avoids cooking, possessing and maintaining cooking gear
and so on and so forth. Not eating after lunch means than no time is lost in
the evening seeking nourishment. However, if following the rules to the letter
involves more complication and loss of time, then obviously the original
intention is lost. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>On
account of the above, the monastic code is observed differently in different
Buddhist countries. Tibet, with remote villages and a population of six million
in a country seven times the size of France and with a freezing climate, was
very different from India. It was simply not possible to go out on a begging
round every day. Thus the monks made a major alms-gathering in the autumn,
after harvest, and stored things for the winter. They tended to follow the
spirit rather than the letter of the rules. In Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand,
the letter is followed more rigorously and it is necessary for bhikkhus (full
monks) to be accompanied by upasakas<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span

life makes necessary when travelling or staying in towns. </span></p>

China is an authentic, unbroken lineage, able to be integrated into the Tibetan

it into their own system. Many have already taken the Chinese vows in
anticipation of this. Those vows have to be maintained properly for a certain

seriously considering taking renunciate's vows (the five groups just mentioned)
are often advised to take the eight main precepts, including celibacy, and to keep
them for a trial period, often six months or a year, so that they have the
experience of quite what it means to live under such liberating constraints.
This is very helpful, as many people's notion of being a monk or a nun is far
too idealised and little connected with the reality of such a life. Some people
over-estimate the renunciate's life as being a solution to their problems. It
will be, if pursued long enough and with enough diligence and faith, but the
simple fact of donning the robes and changing lifestyle cannot change
everything overnight. One must remember that these vows concern primarily body
and speech conduct and many people's problems are related to the way in which
their mind works. The latter takes time, meditation and insight to really
change. Renunciation and monasticism should create a favourable environment in
which that can happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.6pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Taking one of these five sets of
pratimoksha vows entitles a person to wear the monastic robes. The colour and
style of the robes has evolved over time and from country to country. Certain
colours (blue, orange and red) were permitted by the Buddha and the main idea
was to use the cheapest dye available. Chinese and Japanese monastic robes tend
to be black, blue or grey. In the Theravadin countries the robe is a saffron
brown. In Tibet they wear varying shades of maroon. The head is shaved
regularly and the hair not allowed to grow beyond a centimetre or so. This is a
token of following the Buddha, who cut off his magnificent hair when leaving
palace life: thus it is a symbol of renouncing the world. Hair was thought of
as a source of power in ancient India and the way the hair was worn was a
symbol of social status. The Prince Siddharta would have had and ornate pile of
hair, set with jewels to show his royal status. Hair is also of course part of
what is seen as beautiful and sexually attractive. Furthermore, hair grows
back, as do the mind poisons and bad habits, so the regular cutting off of hair
symbolises constant attentiveness to cutting back harmful karma and the
defilements.<a name=heartsutra></a></span></p>

the dhyana absorptions. It is nothing to do with vague, intuitive powers,
trance or the like, as exhibited or claimed by modern &quot;clairvoyants&quot;.
It is a transformation of visual consciousness due to a pure mind: the seeing
is total clarity, can extend across cosmoses and into parallel dimensions, into
microscopic and macroscopic. Maudgalyana possesed all five: clear-seeing,
clear-hearing, knowledge of other's minds, memory of past lives and power to
show miracles. </span></p>
