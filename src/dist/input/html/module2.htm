<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Another
way in which dharma could be described is as the <b>Way of Truth</b>. The word <i>dharma</i>
actually means, “Things as they truly are”. Two of dharma’s main topics are the

being possessors of truth have poisoned the world’s history, one must be very
careful always to remember the genuine universality of the Buddha’s message and
not to get lost in dogma, in sectarianism or the “<i>ism</i>” of Buddhism
itself. Paraphrasing what many of our great masters say,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Having
understood this <b><span style='color:maroon'>universality</span></b> of the
Buddha’s teachings, which simply try to point out, or to help us discover,
things as they really are, one needs equally to appreciate the <b><span
style='color:maroon'>living lineages</span></b> of masters down the ages who
have given these universal truths to the world and maintained their purity.
Without the tremendous compassionate activity of the enlightened beings of the
sangha, who have meticulously handed down the Buddha’s insights from generation
to generation, the world would never know these truths—despite their
universality. Nor would it be able to savour their true meaning and value,
through the unique experience of being in the presence of great masters.
Supporting specific traditions and lineages is not antithetic to the notion of
seeking what is universal. <b>In this module, we will consider dharma generally,
in a sort of overview. Details from its vast and profound content form most of
the rest of the course.</b></span></p>

"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:
"Palatino Linotype"'>What has developed these past 2,500 years, upon the basis
of what the Buddha taught, is <i>Buddh<u>ism</u></i>. Over the centuries, it
has incorporated many, many things, transforming them into skilful Buddhist
tools. Of particular mention are the enormous Greek influx, in art and other
areas, through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhara">Gandhara</a> and
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushan">Kushan</a> dynasties, and
also the integration and transformation of ritualised prayer, as opposed to
simple chanting of the sutras.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:
"Palatino Linotype"'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:
"Palatino Linotype"'>We live today in a unique moment in Buddhism as, in the
modern global village, Buddhist traditions that have existed in isolation for a
thousand years or more are now thrown together under the microscope of the
modern mind. They are being examined and confronted by the world, and they also
have to examine and confront themselves. Which teachings and practices
correspond to what the Buddha Sakyamuni really taught or intended for us? What
was truly inspired by the sambhogakaya aspect of the buddha mind, after
Sakyamuni’s passing, and what, if at all, is merely one or another tradition’s
own propaganda: their words put into the Buddha’s mouth? What is of use in the
world today and what is disposable cultural ballast? Many such questions are
being asked and many are questions without absolute answers. Opinions differ.
In the end, each of us has to make up his or her mind, using good sense and
good judgement. In that respect, &quot;the proof of the pudding is in the eating”
and we are fortunate to have some great Buddhist masters alive and accessible
in this world. Their own achievement and example is an inspiring testimony to
the beliefs and practices they follow. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:
"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:
"Palatino Linotype"'>But caution! The sharpest of intellects and a “modern”
sense of values are maybe not enough to guarantee good judgement. They could
even mislead. For example, if the story of Milarepa took place in the modern
day, his guru Marpa’s treatment of him would be a terrible scandal; totally
unacceptable. Yet it is one of the most inspiring examples of what faith can do
and what tough, uncompromising, enlightened guidance can bring forth from a
person. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#CCFFFF'><span lang=EN-GB

eighty-four thousand key types of experience. But, for all that knowledge and
for all their precious value to the world, the Threefold Collection remains
only concepts ... along with the sounds and letters which convey those concepts
from one human being to another. Their great value is in enabling communication
between those who have understanding and those who do not. Through their use—in
teachings, personal advice, study and sincere reflection—attitudes and values
can evolve and that will impact significantly on someone’s life. In particular,
one learns to discern what ennobles life from that which poisons it. All these
aspects of dharma are called<b> <i>dharma as representations</i></b><span> or <i>relative
dharma</i> or <i>conventional dharma</i></span>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#CCFFFF'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:Arial'>Guided by these teachings and one’s own growing
discernment, one lives the life of a bodhisattva and meditates. This opens many
doors of experience: those of overcoming desire and anger and of feeling
universal love, compassion, impartiality, sympathy, tranquillity in meditation
and so forth. With time, the meaning of the words of dharma comes vividly to
life. From a wide range of <i>experiences</i> emerges first-hand wisdom, known
as <b><i>real</i></b><i>isation</i><span> (in the sense of 'made real')</span>.
Whereas experiences come and go, realisation develops. In fact, although one
can use the word <i>realisation</i> in this broader sense of a growing
awareness of the Four Truths, its use in the scriptures is often confined to
the end result: direct recognition of the void nature of things. The
development of realisation is the result aspect of dharma, known as <b><i>dharma
as realisation</i>. </b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial'>Dharma as direct

knowledge—reason in any of its forms—cannot do this, just as the mere word
'candle' cannot illuminate a dark room. Words may tell us where the candle is
and how to light it, but only the lit candle itself can shed light and dispel
darkness. Only the <u>practice</u> of dharma can enable us to face up to our
imperfections and overcome them with the strength of peace and wisdom. Only
such work on oneself will enable the light of wisdom to shine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
<i>real dharma</i> is the actual awakening of the mind. <i>Conventional dharma</i>
is what enables this to happen. The whole process is called “transforming
consciousness into wisdom”. The superficial <u>consciousness</u> of the mind,
generated by karma and habit, changes every split second and is hypnotically self-preoccupying.
It acts as a veil. As it becomes progressively weakened and removed—by
conventional dharma—then the timeless, unchanging, perfect <u>wisdom</u> and
purity of mind can at last shine through: a little at first and then more and
more until habitual consciousness has been <i>totally</i> replaced by wisdom.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>We
could compare conventional dharma to the instructions about why and how to draw
back the curtains in a dark room, lit by a dim bulb (ordinary thinking). The
first entry of brilliant sunlight and its subsequent increase, revealing the
room’s contents clearly, is like the actual experience of wisdom insight—real
dharma.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#CCFFFF'><span lang=EN-GB

     could say, simply, “Any Buddhism that could be described through words or

     used to describe something more immediate. It is a direct experience,

     make sense to someone whose mind is ready for them. Strictly speaking,
     they are indescribable. Any words which discuss tantra are known as “the
     sutra aspect of tantra’. As tantric (i.e. vajrayana) practices are all
     based upon the idea of awakening to the perfect buddha mind <u>in the very
     moment</u>, the idea of following a “path” is actually seen as an obstacle
     to their development.  They form a special aspect of Mahayana, suited to
     only a few and relying absolutely on a powerful working commitment between
     a qualified guru, holding authentic lineage, and a devoted, diligent

in meditation. That in itself was his first—and a very great—teaching. He did
it to show the profundity of what he had realised; something so deep and
far-reaching that words cannot even begin to convey it. Furthermore, in general
a teaching needs to be given when the time is right, when the listener’s mind
is ready, receptive and respectful. When that time comes, the person will be
drawn to the teacher, will relate to the teaching as something really appreciated
and will assume proper responsibility for carrying it through to fruition. The
Buddha needed to test the world’s readiness.</span></p>

prostrations and offerings, and requested the Buddha to share his understanding
with the world and to launch it into a major cycle of truth and awakening.
(This cycle is said to last for five thousand years, according to some Buddhist
predictions. We find ourselves living at a truly pivotal time for the planet,
just over halfway through this period, in the sixth of ten 500-year periods.

Buddha then went on to teach for some forty-five years, addressing remarkably
varied and sophisticated audiences. India in the 6th century BCE was a land of civilisation
and cultural richness. It was also a place of spiritual intensity, with many
meditative traditions and a sharp intellectual interest in the nature of
reality. Very early on (hard to date this), there were notions comparable to
differential calculus, or perhaps to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereological_nihilism">mereological nihilism</a>,
speculating upon the nature of the smallest building-blocks composing the universe.
Element theory postulated five universal components being present in all

Besides teaching great meditators and intellectuals, the Buddha also taught
everyday people and, most importantly, as time went by, the massive community
of thousands of monks, then nuns, who were his followers. In the Mahayana
scriptures, we read of him also teaching beings invisible to us, some of them
from worldly dimensions, such as <i>devas</i> (gods), spirits and the like, and
others from sublime levels as reality, such as the bodhisattvas and
pratyekabuddhas. The latter had already started their journey long ago as
disciples of the previous Buddha: they appeared to Sakyamuni in subtle bodies
of light imperceptible to ordinary humans. Thus his more clairvoyant followers
saw him not just as a human teaching a crowd of disciples but as the living
presence of absolute truth teaching a vast array of beings stretching
throughout space and existing in superposed, parallel worlds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>In
retrospect, and based on Asanga's teachings, the Tibetans distinguish <b>three
major phases in his teachings</b>. These are known to Buddhists as the <i>Three
Turning of the Wheel of Dharma</i>.  “Dharma”, the word generally used to
denote the Buddha’s teachings, simply means “the way things are”<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=FR style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Palatino Linotype"'>[9]</span></span></span></a>. This massive delivery of
universal truths to our world is compared to the turning of a wheel, since
worlds and individuals come round, again and again, time after time, to a recognition
of these truths, in golden ages when great spiritual teachers manifest. This
wheel is the counterpart to another wheel: that of existence. Time and time
again, like a wheel returning to the same point, one finds oneself angry, in
love, crying, fighting, laughing, born, dying. Fortunately, from time to time,
a light pierces through the fabric of worldliness to connect one to the truth
behind its illusions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The

First Turning</span></i></b></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
first phase of the Buddha’s teachings established the common ground of the
universal truths he had to impart. It is something accessible to almost anyone
who makes enough effort. It reveals much about the nature of worldly existence,
in a way which makes sense to the common perception of reality. Its statements
do not rely on faith and can be confirmed by investigation. The teachings of
this First Turning set out almost all the Buddha’s teachings on relative truth<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=FR style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

truth is mainly focused on non-ego: the voidness of fixed ideas of personality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
absolute priority of the First Turning is to eliminate, or at least reduce, suffering—the
bugbear of the universe. Suffering is not viewed as a virtue by Buddhists.
Although it can be turned into one, it has no intrinsic spiritual value in
itself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Dharma
speaks first and foremost about suffering not because it is a pessimistic, gloomy,
faith but because a tiny amount of suffering can mar a great deal of happiness.
Just as tiny microbes can bring down a whole body, so is suffering spoiling
happiness everywhere. It is through a longing to bring happiness to people that
dharma starts by targeting suffering. Spirituality which does not address
life’s chaos and pain can be likened to bringing delicious grapes to somebody
sick but not providing them with the medicine to cure the sickness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;background:#CCFFFF'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The essence of the First
Turning is contained in the famous <b><span style='color:maroon'>Four Truths</span></b>.
The first two truths are a cause-and-result pair dealing with suffering. The
final two truths are a cause-and-result pair dealing with freedom from
suffering. We will explore them in more detail later in this module. Here is

inhabit it, describing in detail their suffering and happiness. <br>

(<i>karma</i>) generate suffering (<i>samsara</i>) later for their doer.<br>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>In
this First Turning, we encounter the famous <b>Middle Way</b> as a description
of the dharma path. At this stage, it is mainly presented as a way of life and
of spiritual practice that avoids the extremes of over-indulgence and
asceticism. This Middle Way was practised by the Buddha, after his earlier
years spent first in utmost luxury and then in asceticism. The Middle Way also
avoids the extremes of projections of soul <b>(permanence) and negation</b> (of
karmic consequences).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>For
many years, Buddha Sakyamuni taught the way out of suffering and to freedom
from suffering. This involved a host of teachings, methods and the development
of a precise language to analyse and describe the mind and the world. He next introduced
the second phase of his teaching—to many (but not all) disciples; those who had
sufficiently freed their minds and who were ripe for the next step. This phase
is often associated with the caves of Vulture Peak in Rajgir<a href="#_ftn13"

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#CCFFFF'><b><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The first phase emphasised the voidness
of ego</span></b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'> but
described the world in a way that corresponded to the general perception of it
as something existing in its own right. This <b>second phase unveiled the
voidness of absolutely everything</b> inner <i>and</i> outer: people <i>and</i>
their environment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Over
the years of the First Turning, the Buddha had established a very complete
scientific and psychological language, enabling all things material and mental
to be clearly defined and distinguished. The extremely fine analysis of mind,
in particular, was the key factor enabling illusions of personal reality to be
understood and evaporated. The eighteen elements of consciousness, the five
aggregates, the twelve gates of perception, the twelve links of
interdependence, the fifty-one mental events, the thirty-seven factors of
enlightenment: these and many other notions became the everyday language and
working reality the Buddha’s followers. These later became formalised as <i>abhidharma</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>In
the Second Turning, the Buddha revealed all of those key components of mind and
consciousness to be de<i>void</i> of any ultimate reality. Having previously
shown his disciples how to dismantle the ego-illusion machine into its thousand
cogs, he now showed them how even the cogs are illusions, being merely ideas.
The second phase of his teachings is embodied in the <i>prajnaparamita</i> or
Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom. Whereas the first phase spoke to everyone,
the second phase only made sense to those capable of considerable spiritual
maturity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#CCFFFF'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>In this second phase, the Buddha made
the omnipresence of voidness perfectly clear. Its teachings dismantle all conceptual
illusions of reality and even those of non-reality. However, they do not
elucidate the actual nature of ultimate reality—the buddha mind—beyond the
illusions—other than to point out what was absent. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>In
the Second Turning, the <b>Middle Way</b> takes on a second and very profound
meaning, as expounded by Nagarjuna in his Perfection of Wisdom texts: that of
avoiding the four limits and the eight extremes. This will be explained in a
later module. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>As
the deconstruction of all illusions is a powerful and delicate process, it
requires outstanding compassion. This is needed for the work on oneself and for
the way in which one regards other sentient beings. The keynote of the Second
Phase is the omnipresence of compassion and the absolute need for compassion if
one wishes to attain the Buddha's enlightenment. </span></p>

Third Turning</span></i></b></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#CCFFFF'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Once the meaning of voidness, as
expounded in the second phase, was well comprehended, the third phase of the
Buddha’s teaching revealed the actual nature of ultimate voidness. This is not
simply an <i>absence</i> of illusion. It is not <i>merely an emptiness</i>. It
is not vast, virgin space. On the contrary, it is the total, perfect <i>presence</i>
of the love, compassion, wisdom, powers and all the other qualities of
enlightenment. It is an <i>affirmation</i>, as opposed to the <i>negations</i>
of the other two &quot;turnings&quot;. Most importantly, the Buddha taught that
every single sentient being has this ultimate voidness as his, her or its true
nature. Thus the Third Turning of the Wheel of Dharma teaches <i>buddha nature</i>,
the fact that the wisdom and perfection of enlightenment is profoundly present
in everyone, all the time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Following
this, over the centuries, various learned and enlightened teachers wrote treaties—<i>shastra</i>—on
<i>buddha nature</i>. Maitreya’s work—<i>the mahayana uttara tantra shastra</i>,
translated in English with commentary as “Maitreya on Buddha Nature” (see
bibliography at end)—is the greatest of these classics. It is the reference for
all the Tibetan traditions, as well as for Mahayana traditions in China, Korea
and Japan.</span></p>

<h4><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:maroon;
font-weight:normal'>A simple but effective introduction to the term “voidness”</span></i></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
Sanskrit term <i>shunyata</i> translates as <i>voidness</i> or <i>emptiness</i>.
Both English words, and particularly the latter, conjure up visions of hollow,
empty space. To hear of someone “meditating in voidness” conjures up images of
absorption in vast, silent, cosmic spaces. However, such notions do not at all
convey the real meaning of the term <i>shunyata,</i> which describe a clarity,
a wisdom, an awareness that pierces through mind’s illusions. It is called <i>voidness</i>
because it sees the illusions as being “null-and-void”; devoid of the reality
they seem to have had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Let
us take, for example, the phrase <i>the voidness of ego—</i>something taught in
all traditions of Buddhism. This is not talking about some quality of ego, in
the same way one might speak about <i>the sweetness of this cake</i>. It is not
saying that ego <i>exists</i> but that somehow it is spacious and open. The
teachings show us that ego only exists as an illusion: some thing imagined.
That illusion does not correspond to reality. We can imagine Mount Fujiyama in
the centre of Paris but when we check it out, no Mount Fuji is found there.
Hence, investigation shows mind’s imaginary projections of “I” and “me” to be
null-and-void. Realising the voidness our projections, illusions, delusions
etc. is the heart of Buddhist wisdom. We could say, “Realisation of voidness is
wisdom” but this is usually shortened to <i>voidness is wisdom</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>To
look at a mirage but <u>know</u> that there is no water really present on the
horizon is a simple form of voidness-wisdom. Wisdom understands the movements
of light and knows what is happening. It informs us that there is no water,
even though the eyes tell us otherwise. The “voidness” of what seems to be a
distant shimmering lake is the wisdom in the mind of the watcher, no longer
tricked by delusion. But note, this wisdom does not in any way make the mirage
disappear. The optical effect continues exactly as before but now that it is
accompanied by wisdom, one's appreciation of what is there is different. It
saves an awful lot of useless trudging across the sand, to assuage a thirst!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#CCFFFF'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>In another way, voidness is very much
to do with limitlessness. It is the wisdom of an unlimited, free mind that is
not deluded by one or another limited view. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Once
the limiting illusion goes, there is usually a limitlessness. For instance, the
idea of a single, lasting self—some monolithic identity that lasts a
lifetime—is dissolved in Buddhism by a fine analysis of what a human being
really is—an infinitely complex, stream of components, the consciousness of
which changes every split-second.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Furthermore,
any person’s experience of a specific thing is necessarily <u>dependent</u>
upon many <u>limiting</u> factors.  Humans see what humans see and hear what
humans hear. Dogs or bats hear things we cannot. Our senses are very limited.
The messages conveyed to the brain by the senses are severely filtered and then
immediately linked with memories which colour the perception. And so on and so
forth. Each of us has a unique and <u>highly subjective</u> appreciation of
reality. Yet in each person’s mind,<b> that appreciation seems to be reality
itself and is taken as such</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>This
perception of reality is heavily coloured by past karma. Three people in the
same place can find it heaven, hell or indifferent respectively, depending upon
the state of their mind. The state of mind is the consequence of past karma. A
man with rare and expensive fish in his pond may look at them with great pride
and see them primarily as a beautiful possession. A passing heron may view them
as food. Another species of fish may jealously consider it as ugly; not
beautiful at all. The fish will feel like itself, neither a possession nor a
meal. A worm in the fish’s stomach may just experience it as warmth and a
certain smell. A passing deva may see the fish as a n</span><span lang=EN-GB

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Any

was convened by the elder Mahakasyapa and sponsored by the king Ajatashatru,
who erected a building in front of the Sattapanni cave in Rajgir (right, Bihar
state, India). It took place three months after the Buddha’s passing, due to
Mahakasyapa’s concerns about the monastic discipline (<i>vinaya</i>) crumbling
if it were not properly codified. It was attended by 500 fully-liberated monks
(<i>Arhants</i>). Under the guidance of the greatest expert on vinaya at the
time—Upali, who received the direct transmission of vinaya from the Buddha—the
rules for lay and monastic Buddhists were established.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>This
took place in Vesali, also in Bihar. It was to settle a hot dispute which grew
up concerning the minor rules for monastics. It was also to do with flexibility
and the question of which minor rules the Buddha had considered dispensable, in
certain circumstances. The main question was about whether monks or nuns could
carry money. The outcome was a decision to stick strictly to all the minor
rules.</span></p>

Council is only mentioned in the Theravadin tradition. It was convened in 250
BCE under the great emperor Ashoka, the first king to unite much of India. He
had converted to Buddhism and his brother had attained arhantship. His
extraordinary generosity to Buddhism (he is said to have constructed 84,000
Buddhist temples and monastic dwellings) led to corrupt people donning robes
and exploiting the system. This council was convened to deal with corruption
issues arising from this. One of the great outcomes of Ashoka’s reign, and
arguably of this council, was the sending forth of great Buddhist masters
(those who knew the dharma thoroughly by heart) to foreign countries, including

concerning <i>abhidharma</i> (the Buddhist science of mind and matter) were
codified by a team of five hundred scholars under the guidance of a certain
Vasumitra. This is recounted in early Mahayana texts, describing the
Sarvastivadin refutations of abhidharma as codified in the Great Discourse (<i>Mahavibasha</i>).
Sarvastivadin does not exist today as an indepndent school but its ideas on
abhidharma were taken up by Mahayana schools. The codification is said to have
taken twelve years, covering three hundred thousand verses and some nine
million statements. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>It
also seems that this was a defining moment in language, as the early Prakrit
(vernacular) texts were rendered into Sanskrit from then on. Sanskrit had been
a “high” language reserved for Brahmins at the time of the Buddha, who had
insisted that teachings be given in local, common, dialects so as to be
accessible to all. Now, some six centuries later and in a much-changed society,
Sanskrit was seen by Mahayanists to be the best vehicle for writing down the
ancient instructions. Theravadins stuck by the original ruling from the Buddha
and maintained their scriptures in the commoners' Pali.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
truth is that little is known for sure of the history of this. We will consider
Indian Buddhist history and its main teachers in a later module. Here are some
key points:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Mahayanists
     themselves see their teachings as going right back to the historical
     Buddha and believe in the Three Turnings, as explained above. Theravadins
     do not agree. They only accept the First Turning and see Mahayanists as
     breakaway groups wanting to add their own interpretations and developments
     to the original teachings.<br>
     <br>
     </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
     earliest Mahayana writings appeared between the 1st century BCE and the
     2nd century CE. These include such famous works as the Perfection of
     Wisdom (<i>prajnaparamita</i>), Lotus Sutra, Nirvana Sutra etc.
     Mahayanists believe that the Buddha gave these teachings during his lifetime,
     in places such as the Vulture Peak at Rajgir, and that many of the
     Buddha’s followers were either not ready for them—and so were led
     elsewhere by their karma when the teachings were given—or else thought
     they had already heard everything to be heard from the Buddha and so
     excused themselves when he started to teach them.<a href="#_ftn20"

     were written down, they were either preserved as an oral tradition or else
     secreted away, in writing, in other realms, such as the Perfection of
     Wisdom texts, guarded for some six centuries by <i>naga</i> serpent
     spirits and recovered by Nagarjuna.<br>

     </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Mahayana

 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
     two immensely-important Buddhist masters whose own writings and whose

 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Nagarjuna

     </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Asanga
     was born around 300 CE. The tradition stemming from him is known as “the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>We

For now, here are some key points:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>It
     means the way, or vehicle, (<i>yana</i>) of that which is indestructible (<i>vajra</i>).
     This refers to the timeless, perfect, indestructible buddha mind, or
     buddha nature. The vajrayana teachings help one connect with that in the
     present moment. It is also called <i>tantra</i>, which means “thread” in
     Sanskrit. This refers to the continuous, unbroken, thread of buddha mind
     which accompanies the deluded mind every second, throughout the illusion
     of samsara, yet remains unrecognised. The point of these teachings is to
     recognise it.<br>
     <br>
     </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Tibetan
     masters say that some vajrayana lineages started at the time of Sakyamuni
     Buddha, principally the instructions he gave to King Indrabhuti.<br>
     <br>
     </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
     first vajrayana <i>texts</i> appeared around the 5th century CE but
     vajrayana had doubtless existed as a highly-secret, oral tradition,
     practised in forests and mountains by small groups of yogis for many
     centuries before it entered the monasteries, where its teachings became
     “tamer” and integrated with the monastic round, giving rise to the texts.
     It is likely that there was already a thriving vajrayana at the time of
     Asanga, since we know that his epoch was a time of opening for the
     monasteries. It seems to have become more common for the studious monks to
     go off to the jungles and for great siddhas<a href="#_ftn21"

     invited to teach in monasteries.<br>
     <br>
     </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
     vajrayana flourished in India from the 7th through to 12th centuries in
     India. After that time, most Buddhist traditions disappeared, due to a
     violent rise of foreign Islamic invasions and local Hinduism.<br>
     <br>
     </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Vajrayana
     went to Tibet in two great waves: the <i>ancient transmission</i>
     (Nyingma) in the 8th century, with Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava) and the
     other during the 11th and early 12th centuries with the founders of the
     “new traditions” (Sarma). Eight great traditions were transported to Tibet
     by both Indian and Tibetan masters. They are known as the Eight Great
     Chariots.</span></li>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>This
term makes a lot of superficial sense—as we compare it with Japanese or Thai
Buddhism— but it also makes it sound as though Tibet developed its own
Buddhism, which is not really the case. From the 8th through to 12th centuries
CE, both Tibetan and Indian masters transplanted the <u>Indian Buddhism</u> of
that period across the Himalaya to Tibet, in a very complete way. Tibet
received the broadest, most comprehensive “package” of Buddhism—more than any
other country. In the wealth of its literature and techniques, one finds the
overall picture of what otherwise is found only in parts other countries. It was
the only country to preserve  a living wealth of vajrayana.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
way in which our lamas tend to view the development of dharma in India, from
the time of <i>nirmanakaya </i>Buddha Sakyamuni until its disappearance in the
13th century, 1800 years later, is as follows. The Buddha Sakyamuni taught all
levels during his lifetime: Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana. The Mahayana and
Vajrayana continued as secret traditions until this world was ready for them to
be spread at large. As that happened, the <i>sambhogakaya</i>  buddha-mind
either emanated as great teachers or else directly inspired great teachers, who
composed the various Mahayana shastras and the tantras.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>If
we consider this cosmically, rather than historically, the universe is vast and
multi-dimensional. The pure buddha mind is the constant backdrop to its
ever-changing fabric. Whenever someone is truly ready, for whichever level of
teaching it be, that buddha mind will appear in their existence, guiding and
teaching them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>

<h4><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:maroon;
font-weight:normal'>Sutra and Shastra</span></i></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>During
his forty-five years of teaching, the Buddha gave many detailed explanations
about all sorts of topics. These were mostly taught in response to questions,
in this place or that place, sometimes simply and sometimes profoundly.
Everything recorded of the Buddha’s own teachings fills over one hundred thick
volumes of Tibetan scripture, in a collection known as the <b><i>Kanjur</i></b><i>
</i>(<i>bka ‘gyur</i>), which means “Sacred Instruction Translated”. If we take
a typical topic—such as karma—we will find various teachings on it scattered
throughout the hundred volumes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Therefore
we can understand the value of the tremendous work accomplished by the greatest
Buddhist masters, such as Nagarjuna, Asanga and their disciples, in compiling
information on key topics and presenting it to us as a coherent whole. They
themselves had encyclopaedic understanding of the Kanjur and had clear,
enlightened minds. The works they composed were not commentaries
properly-speaking, on the Buddha’s teachings, as a commentary usually takes original
verses and elaborates on them, word by word, meaning by meaning. They were
brilliant analytical presentations. We call them <i>shastra</i> and call the
Buddha’s own teachings <i>sutra</i>. The traditional collection of the great <i>shastra</i>
in Tibetan translation is known as the <b><i>Tenjur</i></b> (<i>bstan ‘gyur</i>),
meaning “shastras translated”. It has more than two hundred volumes.</span></p>

Buddhist texts. It sounds dignified but, according to Tibetans, is not quite true
to the original meaning of the <i>noble</i> in those ideas. The original
Sanskrit <i>arya</i>, and later the Tibetan <i>‘phags pa</i>, are not adjectives
describing the Truths or the Path as “noble” but words telling us that the Four
Truths are understood clearly only by “noble beings”,  <i>aryas</i>,  meaning
those who have transcended worldly rebirth forever. Likewise it is the

meeting up again with the group of five, so the latter were not technically the

not mention the Dharmachakra Sutra as such but say that the Buddha would teach
some of the five disciples while the others went off to beg for food for the six
of them. The five learned in a sort of rota. It seems that the essence of what
the Buddha taught them during this period was later summed up apocryphally as
the Dharmachakra Sutra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Humankind
has developed many religions and philosophies. They each have their own
explanations of life’s meaning, purpose and possibilities. Some believe their
teachings came directly from a divine creator and that our purpose is to serve
that creator. Some believe in an after-life whereas others insist that
consciousness ceases totally at physical death. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#CCFFFF'><span lang=EN-GB

has neither God nor abstract ideals as its central focus but a very real
emancipation of suffering. All the teachings are there for that purpose: not to
help us serve the Buddha or to follow his teachings simply because he said we
should; not for personal ecstasy or for power or even to satiate our intellect's
curiosity about existence but to help us understand, confront and relieve
suffering. This means dealing <i>in very real terms</i> with the suffering both
in oneself and in others and to work positively to bring happiness to the
world. More than that, dharma is seen as the way to plant the seeds of
long-term future happiness in the world and to create a wiser and more
harmonious society. It is the way to find the highest happiness “beyond the
world”: that of an enlightened mind. </span></p>

     A “composite thing” (also known as a “compound” or “compounded

     “Tainted” generally means tainted by self-centredness and the pride,

     In the Hinayana teachings this is mainly applied to sentient beings, whose

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>It is
the common ground of all Buddhism. It was taught at length and in detail by the
Enlightened One to a general public. Its teachings are recognised and practised
by almost all schools of Buddhism. They deal practically with tangible things:
life at it is, the mind as we can observe it and they expound a set of “natural
ethics” based upon respect for life and non-violence, generosity of spirit and
self-mastery. The main focus is on the reduction and eventually the total
elimination of suffering. This first turning addresses two sorts of audience
through its two aspects of truth:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
     <b>relative truth</b> aspect of its teachings outlines the processes of
     cause-and-effect which weave the very fabric of existence. They show how a
     person’s actions (<i>karma</i>) will determine their happiness or
     suffering in future lives. The wholesome acts, known as “virtue”, generate
     happiness. &quot;Non-virtue&quot; generates suffering. By avoiding
     non-virtue and practising virtue, anyone can expect his or her future
     lives to be better and hence this aspect of the teachings can readily and
     willingly be put into practice by anyone, according to their capacity. </span></li>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
     <b>ultimate truth</b> aspect of its teachings points to the total illusion
     of notions of self or personality and the fact that any worldly existence
     is a prison-like suffering compared with nirvana. This aspect of the
     teachings can only really be applied by renunciates, willing to abandon a
     personal, worldly existence and able to practice meditation. Within the
     peaceful stability of meditation, their thoughts and feelings can be
     worked with in the light of wisdom.    </span></li>

go on endlessly, as a sort of self-perpetuating mechanism, unless something is

harmful things in the mind, which lead into ego-centred realities. There is the
struggle for affection, recognition and companionship; the sexual drive; the
wish for power and there is also a habitual self-centredness and fear which
stifles altruism. All of those things (and many others which we will look at in

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";

others, in the short term, and for themselves in the long term, through the
play of karma. They simply do not know enough about life’s immutable causal
mechanisms or about the nature of change: impermanence. There is a further
level to add to this: each person’s samsara is a very sorry sate of affairs
compared with how their mind could be, if only they knew what was possible. The
price of fleeting happiness in this world is disproportional and almost always
entails considerable suffering. All the Buddha’s life and teachings are about
reducing and getting rid of this unnecessary suffering forever.</span></p>

detail in Module 9. It is defined as being the instability that is the very
nature of any <i>composite phenomenon</i>, i.e. <u>anything</u> that arises due
to the coming-together of prime causes and secondary conditions. Based on the famous
saying found in the <i>Collection of Aphorisms,</i> Gampopa sums it up:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.85pt;margin-bottom:

its three aspects and in terms of its manifestation in the six realms—will be
developed immediately below in considerable detail<i>.</i> The suffering of
samsara is defined as an inability to satisfy and an unexpected sting<a

with the previous point, impermanence. Everything changes. Nothing lasts. Thus,
whenever someone clings—to health, youth, beauty, their parents, children,
status, reputation, lovers or whatever impermanent thing gives them
happiness—there will be suffering when that person or thing changes or
disappears. The more one clings, the more there is suffering through the pain
of loss. Furthermore, much harmful karma is created in trying to resist
inevitable change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";
color:maroon'>Voidness</span></i></b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>
is defined as the actual true nature of the illusory things through which one
suffers. In its simplest and most universal explanation of this point, the
people and things through which one suffers are demonstrated to be, on an
absolute level, no more than a momentary concatenation of atoms. What we perceive
is a gross, very partial, frozen image based on the dance of those atoms.</span></p>

defined similarly to the above but is related to the perceiving mind; the
illusory, suffering mind. On a level of absolute truth, there is no sufferer
but merely a sequence of separate moments of consciousness. The frames of a
cinema film are each an individual image yet when they run one after another
they give an impression of a single, lasting reality. Likewise, the
split-second moments of minds consciousness, cognition and so forth give the
impression of a lasting self, of a “person” who suffers. No such self can ever
be found. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#CCFFFF'><span lang=EN-GB

     through impermanence described in the previous section, there is a major
     aspect of suffering through change that is related to karma and ignorance.
     To the uninformed eye, it does not look like suffering. In fact, it often
     appears like someone having a good time. However, the very things that are
     being done, to have that “good time”, are setting in motion mechanisms of
     suffering. An extreme example would be someone enjoying hurting another
     being, like a hunter enjoying a day in the forest shooting deer. In that
     particular case, it may be the highlight of the person’s week: their
     greatest happiness and something to really look forward to. Yet, through
     the inevitable cosmic laws of cause-and-effect, taught by the Buddha, we
     know that the hunter will be reborn to suffer tremendously, physically, on
     account of such acts. The sufferings will be immeasurably greater than the
     fleeting moments of pleasure enjoyed while shooting. <br>
     Many everyday actions that people perform—from spraying the bugs on their
     roses to cheating the taxman—fall into this category, which can be defined
     as creating the karma of suffering through actions intended to bring
     pleasure or to combat the unpleasant.</span></li>

     suffering is only known to very pure beings. From the beauty, liberation,

     of regular existence—even when it is at its best—is a dark, limited state
     of affairs. Such noble beings, <i>arya</i>, see that to ignore the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>These
three are linked. Through <i>the suffering of the composite</i>, we ignore how
happy, free and wise the mind is in its natural, uncontrived state. We get
involved in all sorts of ventures and situations, in an attempt to find
happiness for ourselves, but due to the <i>suffering through change</i>, our
ignorance of cause-and-effect means that often our attempts to find happiness
are triggering unhappiness for the future. When that future comes, there is <i>suffering
as suffering</i>. Therefore the scriptures compare samsara to poisoned rice. By
its very nature, it is poisoned. Not knowing this, one eats it and finds it
delicious and nourishing. But because of the poison, one later falls ill and
writhes in agony.    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>We
only have to look around here on Earth, on land or in the oceans or through a
microscope, to appreciate the almost limitless and breath-taking variety of
living beings, not to mention those which might exist elsewhere. Mahayana
Buddhism, while recognising an endless number of types of being, discerns six
major categories, known as the “six realms of samsara”. There is a tendency
these days among certain Buddhist teachers to take these solely as a metaphor
for the range of different experiences of the human psyche. Although that is
very useful, as a tool for understanding our human minds and human karma, our
greatest contemporary masters say beyond any doubt that the Buddha taught these
as actual states of being into which one can be reborn. Of the six, most humans
only experience two; those of other humans and animals. The existence of the
remaining four has to be taken on trust: trust of the Buddha’s own teachings
and trust of the experience of other realms which arises in the clear
meditations of accomplished Buddhist masters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>In
Hinayana Buddhism, mind and matter are different and the various realms have
“geographical” existence. The locations are mentioned in each section below. In
Mahayana Buddhism, everything is mind and hence the question as to whether
hells exist as real places or not becomes redundant. In this respect, please
note Gampopa’s comments about the hells, at the end of that section.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
god realms are as good—in material terms—as samsara gets. Gods’ bodies (some
have bodies of light) and the realms in which they live, not to mention the joy
and harmony between them, are for the most part delightful, although some gods
have a wicked side. These godly—of if we use the Sanskrit word <i>deva</i>—
existences occur as a result of strong and virtuous karma in previous lives.
There are three main categories of gods:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Sense-dimension
     gods</span></b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>.
     As the name suggests, their worlds are sensorial, filled with visual
     beauty, pleasant sounds, pleasant companions and consorts etc. These
     result from former powerful practice of generosity, pure conduct and
     forbearance. These actions, accomplished in what appears to the realms of
     the senses, bring joyful sensorial results. There are six main levels of
     these gods<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span
     class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=FR
     style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>[26]</span></span></span></a></span></li>

     gods.</span></b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'> 
     These are rebirth-states in which the experience is not of sensorial
     beauty but of meditative absorption. It is very long-lasting and
     uninterrupted and produced by virtue and prowess in similar meditations
     when human. There are four main categories with seventeen sub-categories, <u>of
     which only the first twelve belong to samsara</u>. The others are only
     accessible to beings who have gone beyond individuality and rebirth.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Formless
     gods.</span></b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>
     These are rebirths into a state on ongoing formless meditation, produced
     by the impetus of mastery of formless meditation whilst human. There are
     four levels.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Thus,
altogether, there are twenty-seven levels of gods of which twenty-two fall
within samsara.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
<b>sufferings</b> of the gods are those of having to protect their vast
possessions and to fend off the attacks of the jealous demi-gods (see below),
of dissatisfaction due to unsatiated desires but principally those of decline
and fall, when their karma to remain in the god realms eventually runs out.
They have become so accustomed to the beauty or the purity of their realms, and
to all the power and possibilities associated with their state, that the pain
of losing it all is unbearable. They have considerable clairvoyance and foresee
their coming rebirth long before it happens. This prospect is overwhelmingly
sad and unbelievable, as their pride, which in this context means “taking for
granted” (see below) finds it so hard to accept that there can be no other
outcome but a fall into a much, much worse state, often, as it happens, the
lower realms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
<b>defining characteristic</b> of the god realms is <b>pride</b>. This can be
taken to mean arrogance and haughtiness but it often has a much broader meaning
of “identifying with being on top”<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=FR
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>[27]</span></span></span></a>.
The gods are where they are through their good karma but rather than
understanding their condition to be a transient moment of good fortune, they
feel that it is “their place”, “their right”, forever. We could take the
example of a person born a billionaire in our world, who would find it
completely natural to be flown around in a private jet, to have a home filled
afresh with expensive flowers every day and so on and so forth, even though
others are penniless. It feels natural - to him! Thus, there is presumption and
complacency.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>   
It was the combination of pride with good karma which caused gods to be reborn
as they are and that is why it is important for us, as we create virtue, to
remain humble and to dedicate it to a useful rebirth, preferably as a human.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>   
Another defining characteristic of the gods is <b>spiritual laziness</b>. This
is a direct consequence of their pride and the feeling that things will always
be that good. There is not the stimulation of experiencing suffering, either in
themselves or the world around them, to trigger the compassion which is the
keynote of spirituality. When they do start to suffer, as they see their
forthcoming nemesis, they are too filled with fear and self-pity to give space
to spirituality.      </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

     <br>
         This whole period of “birth” is governed by helplessness and
     unavoidable experience. The <i>bardo</i> is like a wild dream in which one
     is flung here and there, from one crazy experience to another. It ends
     with a series of powerful experiences, heralding conception and the future
     life. These experiences and the various stages of experience in the dark
     confines of the womb, once conception has taken place, are vividly
     described in Gampopa. <br>
        Once born, one is unable to speak, take care of oneself and so forth

     When, like this, one has been tormented on the torture spike of death, one
     is no longer so arrogant. One is without protectors, allies or friend.
     Stricken by disease, the mouth is thirsty, one's face changes, the limbs
     give way, one is unable to work and filthies one's body with saliva, snot,
     urine and disgusting vomit and wheezes noisily. The doctors abandon hope,
     one sleeps on one's bed for the last time, sinks into the stream of
     samsara and becomes frightened of the Lord of Death's emissaries. The
     breathing stops, the mouth and nostrils gape. One leaves behind this world
     and heads for the next. It is the great departure, the entrance into
     deepest darkness, the fall over the greatest precipice and the mighty
     ocean sweeping one away. Borne away by the wind of karma, one goes to the
     place of no settling and this without being able to take one iota of one's
     possessions. Though one cries out <i>Oh, mother! Oh father! Oh my

unfortunate rebirth due to past non-virtuous karma. Besides the specific

hell, just as a dreamer has a nightmare in which the horrible circumstances

so called because he was born with a divine jewel worth a million ounces of
gold set in his ear. He set out as a merchant, in order to please his father,
but became abandoned by his servants and then lost in a desert, where he spent
twelve years with various types of deprived spirits. They were lucid about the
past karmas which had caused their plight and gave him messages for the human
realm, to which he returned. He became a monk under the great disciple
Katayana, gaining deep realisation.</span></p>
