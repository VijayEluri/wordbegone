Dharma is not a religion <a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>, neither is it a philosophy <a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>. It is usually described as <bold>a way</bold> , i.e. a way of living, a way to attain liberation and a path to a certain end (Nirvana). As such, it is famous as the:</paragraph><paragraph>· <bold>Middle Way</bold> , through its avoidance of extremes, or as the</paragraph><paragraph>· <bold>Path of Peace</bold> , through its profound care for life in all its forms and its teachings which tame the agitated, harmful mind.</paragraph><paragraph>Another way in which dharma could be described is as the <bold>Way of Truth</bold> . The word <italic>dharma</italic> actually means, "Things as they truly are". Two of dharma's main topics are the <bold>Two Truths</bold> and the <bold>Four Truths</bold> . However, as religious claims to being possessors of truth have poisoned the world's history, one must be very careful always to remember the genuine universality of the Buddha's message and not to get lost in dogma, in sectarianism or the " <italic>ism</italic> " of Buddhism itself. Paraphrasing what many of our great masters say,</paragraph><paragraph>If you are a good person, caring, kind and compassionate and devoted to awakening your mind to truth, you are what could be called "a natural Buddhist", whichever belief you subscribe to officially, as you are in accord with what is the true nature of things. Even if you ardently wear a Buddhist badge but are not those things, then there is nothing Buddhist about you. <a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></paragraph><paragraph>As Dr Saddhatissa said, in Samye Ling:</paragraph><paragraph>The Enlightened One did not come to this world to found a religion, but to help everyone, however he could.</paragraph><paragraph>And as many masters say,</paragraph><paragraph> <italic>Whatever proves itself to be true, that <underline>is</underline> the Buddist teaching.</italic> </paragraph><paragraph>And the Buddha himself is famous for having invited his disciples again and again never to believe something simply because he had declared it, but to put it to the test themselves, whenever that was practicable.</paragraph><paragraph>"There are two types of teacher and student. The <italic>old-brains</italic> are content to learn by heart and pass on that tradition. The <italic>new brains</italic> think about what they are studying." the late Prof. Khenpo Troru Tsenam a master and physician of insatiable curiosity, who strove to bring Tibetan medicine and dharma to life and into the modern world</paragraph><paragraph>Having understood this <bold>universality</bold> of the Buddha's teachings, which simply try to point out, or to help us discover, things as they really are, one needs equally to appreciate the <bold>living lineages</bold> of masters down the ages who have given these universal truths to the world and maintained their purity. Without the tremendous compassionate activity of the enlightened beings of the sangha, who have meticulously handed down the Buddha's insights from generation to generation, the world would never know these truths—despite their universality. Nor would it be able to savour their true meaning and value, through the unique experience of being in the presence of great masters. Supporting specific traditions and lineages is not antithetic to the notion of seeking what is universal. <bold>In this module, we will consider dharma generally, in a sort of overview. Details from its vast and profound content form most of the rest of the course.</bold> </paragraph><image width="455" src="module2_files.image003.png" align=""/><paragraph><essential> <italic>a page of an exceedingly rare text, handwritten in both Sanskrit and Tibetan, by Naropa and Marpa</italic> </essential></paragraph></subsection><subsection title="What the Buddha Originally Taught &amp; &#34;Buddhism&#34;" pagetitle="What the Buddha Originally Taught &amp; &#34;Buddhism&#34;" tocentry="What the Buddha Originally Taught &amp; &#34;Buddhism&#34;"><italic>What the Buddha Originally Taught &amp; "Buddhism"</italic><paragraph><essential>What has developed these past 2,500 years, upon the basis of what the Buddha taught, is <italic>Buddh <underline>ism</underline> </italic> . Over the centuries, it has incorporated many, many things, transforming them into skilful Buddhist tools. Of particular mention are the enormous Greek influx, in art and other areas, through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhara">Gandhara</a>and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushan">Kushan</a>dynasties, and also the integration and transformation of ritualised prayer, as opposed to simple chanting of the sutras.</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>We live today in a unique moment in Buddhism as, in the modern global village, Buddhist traditions that have existed in isolation for a thousand years or more are now thrown together under the microscope of the modern mind. They are being examined and confronted by the world, and they also have to examine and confront themselves. Which teachings and practices correspond to what the Buddha Sakyamuni really taught or intended for us? What was truly inspired by the sambhogakaya aspect of the buddha mind, after Sakyamuni's passing, and what, if at all, is merely one or another tradition's own propaganda: their words put into the Buddha's mouth? What is of use in the world today and what is disposable cultural ballast? Many such questions are being asked and many are questions without absolute answers. Opinions differ. In the end, each of us has to make up his or her mind, using good sense and good judgement. In that respect, "the proof of the pudding is in the eating" and we are fortunate to have some great Buddhist masters alive and accessible in this world. Their own achievement and example is an inspiring testimony to the beliefs and practices they follow.</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>But caution! The sharpest of intellects and a "modern" sense of values are maybe not enough to guarantee good judgement. They could even mislead. For example, if the story of Milarepa took place in the modern day, his guru Marpa's treatment of him would be a terrible scandal; totally unacceptable. Yet it is one of the most inspiring examples of what faith can do and what tough, uncompromising, enlightened guidance can bring forth from a person.</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>Now, after these reflections, let us enter into a more traditional overview:</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential> <bold> <italic>There are two main aspects to dharma:</italic> </bold> </essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>· <bold> <italic>Conventional dharma</italic> </bold> —consisting of the concepts, words and scriptures of Buddhist theory along with all the detailed practice instructions that enable a person to evolve. These are well-structured and clearly-explained and they are there to help us give rise to ...</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>· <bold> <italic>Real dharma</italic> </bold> —which is the totally-personal, <italic>experiential</italic> journey of awakening as the mind frees its shackles and burdens and enters into ever-deeper insight into truth about existence, while opening up the loving, compassionate heart. These ever-changing experiences are there to give birth progressively to a deep <italic>wisdom</italic> , known as <italic>realisation</italic> . That is the "ultimate real dharma".</essential></paragraph><paragraph>Of these two, the first is more <italic>outer</italic> and the second more <italic>inner</italic> . The first is <italic>describable</italic> and can be passed from one person to another. The second is <italic>indescribable</italic> and very intimate and personal. The first is a <italic>cause</italic> , giving rise to the second, a <italic>result</italic> . We will consider these two aspects in the traditional Mahayana way, as taught at Samye Ling by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche and reproduced in "Maitreya on Buddha Nature".</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Explanation of the Two Aspects of Dharma from &#34;Maitreya on Buddha Nature&#34;" pagetitle="Explanation of the Two Aspects of Dharma from &#34;Maitreya on Buddha Nature&#34;" tocentry="Explanation of the Two Aspects of Dharma from &#34;Maitreya on Buddha Nature&#34;"><italic>Explanation of the Two Aspects of Dharma from "Maitreya on Buddha Nature"</italic><paragraph>10. <italic>The dharma is that imbued with</italic> </paragraph><paragraph> <italic>the intrinsic characteristics of the two truths:</italic> </paragraph><paragraph> <italic>that which is and that which causes freedom from bondage. <superscript>19</superscript> </italic> </paragraph><paragraph> <italic>Inconceivable, not two and concept-free,</italic> </paragraph><paragraph> <italic>purity, clarity and remedy.</italic> </paragraph><paragraph>Buddhadharma—the famous Buddhist Path of Peace—is the second Refuge. The Refuges exist as cause Refuges and result Refuges. Cause <italic>dharma</italic> consists of all the concepts which together make the Buddhist teaching. These concepts have been perpetuated through the spoken word and through writings, primarily those of the original canon received from the Buddha, consisting of <italic>sūtra, vinaya,</italic>  <italic>abhidharma</italic> (the Triple Collection <a href="#_ftn5"> <superscript>1</superscript> </a>) and <italic>tantra.</italic> To this must be added the principal treatises ( <italic>shas tra</italic> ), written by Buddhist teachers over the past 2,500 years, explaining this canon.</paragraph><paragraph><essential>The Triple Collection ( <italic>tripitaka</italic> ) represents remedies for the three main mind poisons:</essential></paragraph><list kind="ol"><item><essential>The <bold> <italic>sūtras</italic> </bold> are discourses on taming the mind, seen as the main antidote to anger.</essential></item><item><essential>The ethical guidance of the <bold> <italic>vinaya</italic> </bold> is the antidote to desire and</essential></item><item><essential>The precise analysis of mind and matter in the <bold> <italic>abhidharma</italic> </bold> is the antidote to ignorance.</essential></item></list><paragraph><essential>Taken together, the three collections discuss eighty-four thousand key types of experience. But, for all that knowledge and for all their precious value to the world, the Threefold Collection remains only concepts ... along with the sounds and letters which convey those concepts from one human being to another. Their great value is in enabling communication between those who have understanding and those who do not. Through their use—in teachings, personal advice, study and sincere reflection—attitudes and values can evolve and that will impact significantly on someone's life. In particular, one learns to discern what ennobles life from that which poisons it. All these aspects of dharma are called <bold> <italic>dharma as representations</italic> </bold> or <italic>relative dharma</italic> or <italic>conventional dharma</italic> .</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>Guided by these teachings and one's own growing discernment, one lives the life of a bodhisattva and meditates. This opens many doors of experience: those of overcoming desire and anger and of feeling universal love, compassion, impartiality, sympathy, tranquillity in meditation and so forth. With time, the meaning of the words of dharma comes vividly to life. From a wide range of <italic>experiences</italic> emerges first-hand wisdom, known as <bold> <italic>real</italic> </bold>  <italic>isation</italic> (in the sense of 'made real') . Whereas experiences come and go, realisation develops. In fact, although one can use the word <italic>realisation</italic> in this broader sense of a growing awareness of the Four Truths, its use in the scriptures is often confined to the end result: direct recognition of the void nature of things. The development of realisation is the result aspect of dharma, known as <bold> <italic>dharma as realisation</italic> .</bold> </essential></paragraph><paragraph>Dharma as direct realisation is true dharma whereas dharma as representation is its pale reflection in the waters of the intellect. The <italic>Uttara Tantra</italic> is almost solely concerned with dharma as realisation, which has two functions:</paragraph><list kind="ol"><item>It has the power to eliminate all defilements and</item><item>The power to bring about the full fruition of primordial wisdom.</item></list><paragraph>Intellectual knowledge—reason in any of its forms—cannot do this, just as the mere word 'candle' cannot illuminate a dark room. Words may tell us where the candle is and how to light it, but only the lit candle itself can shed light and dispel darkness. Only the <underline>practice</underline> of dharma can enable us to face up to our imperfections and overcome them with the strength of peace and wisdom. Only such work on oneself will enable the light of wisdom to shine.</paragraph><paragraph><essential>The dharma journey of personal experience and realisation is in fact a journey of liberation from that which binds us to a life spoilt by physical and mental suffering. There are <bold>three main types of bondage</bold>:</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>1. the <bold> <italic>defilements</italic> </bold>: desire, anger, ignorance, pride, doubt and distorted views of reality, along with all their hybrid forms such as narcissism, jealousy, hypocrisy, frustration etc. <a href="#_ftn6"> <superscript>2</superscript> </a></essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>2. A deluded understanding, built of dualistic concepts, because one has not recognised the true nature of one's mind. This is called the <bold> <italic>cognitive obscuration</italic> </bold> .</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>3. Limitations and <bold>blockages in meditation</bold> .</essential></paragraph><paragraph>These three are intimately related. Through inability in meditation, one is unable to rest easily and continuously in non-dual ultimate truth. In a darkness of ignorance, all sorts of confused dualistic perceptions and ideas occur. It is through them that desires, aversions and all the other grosser pollutions develop.</paragraph><paragraph>[End of passage from "Maitreya on Buddha Nature"]</paragraph><subsubsection title="An analogy for the relation between conventional and real dharma" pagetitle="An analogy for the relation between conventional and real dharma" tocentry="An analogy for the relation between conventional and real dharma">An analogy for the relation between conventional and real dharma<paragraph>The <italic>real dharma</italic> is the actual awakening of the mind. <italic>Conventional dharma</italic> is what enables this to happen. The whole process is called "transforming consciousness into wisdom". The superficial <underline>consciousness</underline> of the mind, generated by karma and habit, changes every split second and is hypnotically self-preoccupying. It acts as a veil. As it becomes progressively weakened and removed—by conventional dharma—then the timeless, unchanging, perfect <underline>wisdom</underline> and purity of mind can at last shine through: a little at first and then more and more until habitual consciousness has been <italic>totally</italic> replaced by wisdom.</paragraph><paragraph>We could compare conventional dharma to the instructions about why and how to draw back the curtains in a dark room, lit by a dim bulb (ordinary thinking). The first entry of brilliant sunlight and its subsequent increase, revealing the room's contents clearly, is like the actual experience of wisdom insight—real dharma.</paragraph><paragraph><essential>We should never underestimate the value of "real dharma". The Perfection of Wisdom teachings insist, at great length, on how mere instants of real dharma are worth ages of conventional dharma.</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>Although this is so, with the exception of one person in a billion, a thorough development of conventional dharma is the condition <italic>sine qua non</italic> for real dharma to manifest.</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>In the Kagyu tradition, <underline>faith and devotion</underline> are highly-valued as a prime catalyst of real dharma.

Please note that when this is the case the word "sutra" has a much broader meaning than we just saw above:</essential></paragraph><list kind="ul"><item>" Sutra " is a term covering sutra, vinaya and abhidharma, i.e. all the Triple Collection. It includes all the various teachings and practices of Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism. One could say, simply, "Any Buddhism that could be described through words or thought about". Sutra teachings all form part of a graduated path of practice, leading to enlightenment.</item><item>" Tantra  [5]" is a term used to describe something more immediate. It is a direct experience, induced by practices which are secret by their very nature, i.e. they only make sense to someone whose mind is ready for them. Strictly speaking, they are indescribable. Any words which discuss tantra are known as "the sutra aspect of tantra'. As tantric (i.e. vajrayana) practices are all based upon the idea of awakening to the perfect buddha mind in the very moment , the idea of following a "path" is actually seen as an obstacle to their development. They form a special aspect of Mahayana, suited to only a few and relying absolutely on a powerful working commitment between a qualified guru, holding authentic lineage, and a devoted, diligent disciple.</item></list><paragraph><essential>Dharma is often presented as having <bold>three main components</bold> related to the Threefold Collection:</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>1. <bold>Right conduct</bold> , of which the Vinaya teachings on ethics form the basis.</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>2. <bold>Meditation</bold> , as taught in the discourses of the Sutra.</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>3. <bold>Wisdom</bold> , of which the Abhidharma texts form an important part, as they give us the terminology and definitions needed for clear intellectual understanding and communication. However, one must never forget that <italic>deep</italic> wisdom, as expressed sometimes through the Sanskrit terms <italic>prajna</italic> and at any time through <italic>jnana</italic> , is not at all related to the thinking mind.</essential></paragraph><paragraph>Furthermore, dharma is often described as "profound and vast". This is not just poetic appreciation:</paragraph><paragraph>· <bold> <italic>deep</italic> </bold> dharma refers to the teachings on voidness: voidness of ego in the Hinayana and voidness of every thing in the Mahayana. It is also often a codeword for teachings coming through Nagajuna's tradition.</paragraph><paragraph>· <bold> <italic>vast</italic> </bold> dharma refers to all the teachings about cause-and-effect, interdependence etc. They are vast because they describe all the different worlds of beings and all the stages of the spiritual path. This is also a codeword for teachings coming through Asanga's tradition.</paragraph></subsection></section><section index="3" title="The Three Major Phases of the Buddha's Teaching" pagetitle="The Three Major Phases of the Buddha's Teaching" tocentry="The Three Major Phases of the Buddha's Teaching"><subsection title="The Three Major Phases of the Buddha's Teaching" pagetitle="The Three Major Phases of the Buddha's Teaching" tocentry="The Three Major Phases of the Buddha's Teaching"><image width="479" src="module2_files.image004.png" align=""/><paragraph>Having attained enlightenment, the Buddha did not rush into teaching but remained silent for weeks <a href="#_ftn8">[6]</a>, in meditation. That in itself was his first—and a very great—teaching. He did it to show the profundity of what he had realised; something so deep and far-reaching that words cannot even begin to convey it. Furthermore, in general a teaching needs to be given when the time is right, when the listener's mind is ready, receptive and respectful. When that time comes, the person will be drawn to the teacher, will relate to the teaching as something really appreciated and will assume proper responsibility for carrying it through to fruition. The Buddha needed to test the world's readiness.</paragraph><paragraph>On behalf of our world, the gods Brahma and Indra are said to have come, made prostrations and offerings, and requested the Buddha to share his understanding with the world and to launch it into a major cycle of truth and awakening. (This cycle is said to last for five thousand years, according to some Buddhist predictions. We find ourselves living at a truly pivotal time for the planet, just over halfway through this period, in the sixth of ten 500-year periods. This is known as the <italic>Time for Virtue</italic> .)</paragraph><paragraph>The Buddha then went on to teach for some forty-five years, addressing remarkably varied and sophisticated audiences. India in the 6th century BCE was a land of civilisation and cultural richness. It was also a place of spiritual intensity, with many meditative traditions and a sharp intellectual interest in the nature of reality. Very early on (hard to date this), there were notions comparable to differential calculus, or perhaps to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereological_nihilism">mereological nihilism</a>, speculating upon the nature of the smallest building-blocks composing the universe. Element theory postulated five universal components being present in all material things: mass, attraction, energy, motion and space <a href="#_ftn9">[7]</a>. It makes one think of the physics of this century <a href="#_ftn10">[8]</a>. Besides teaching great meditators and intellectuals, the Buddha also taught everyday people and, most importantly, as time went by, the massive community of thousands of monks, then nuns, who were his followers. In the Mahayana scriptures, we read of him also teaching beings invisible to us, some of them from worldly dimensions, such as <italic>devas</italic> (gods), spirits and the like, and others from sublime levels as reality, such as the bodhisattvas and pratyekabuddhas. The latter had already started their journey long ago as disciples of the previous Buddha: they appeared to Sakyamuni in subtle bodies of light imperceptible to ordinary humans. Thus his more clairvoyant followers saw him not just as a human teaching a crowd of disciples but as the living presence of absolute truth teaching a vast array of beings stretching throughout space and existing in superposed, parallel worlds.</paragraph><paragraph>In retrospect, and based on Asanga's teachings, the Tibetans distinguish <bold>three major phases in his teachings</bold> . These are known to Buddhists as the <italic>Three Turning of the Wheel of Dharma</italic> . "Dharma", the word generally used to denote the Buddha's teachings, simply means "the way things are" <a href="#_ftn11">[9]</a>. This massive delivery of universal truths to our world is compared to the turning of a wheel, since worlds and individuals come round, again and again, time after time, to a recognition of these truths, in golden ages when great spiritual teachers manifest. This wheel is the counterpart to another wheel: that of existence. Time and time again, like a wheel returning to the same point, one finds oneself angry, in love, crying, fighting, laughing, born, dying. Fortunately, from time to time, a light pierces through the fabric of worldliness to connect one to the truth behind its illusions.</paragraph><paragraph>The original Sanskrit phrase "turn the wheel of dharma" loses a lot in translation and had incredibly powerful overtones, giving the impression of a mighty thing of cosmic significance happening.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="The First Turning" pagetitle="The First Turning" tocentry="The First Turning"><italic>The First Turning</italic><paragraph>The first phase of the Buddha's teachings established the common ground of the universal truths he had to impart. It is something accessible to almost anyone who makes enough effort. It reveals much about the nature of worldly existence, in a way which makes sense to the common perception of reality. Its statements do not rely on faith and can be confirmed by investigation. The teachings of this First Turning set out almost all the Buddha's teachings on relative truth <a href="#_ftn12">[10]</a>. Its discussion of absolute truth is mainly focused on non-ego: the voidness of fixed ideas of personality.</paragraph><paragraph>The absolute priority of the First Turning is to eliminate, or at least reduce, suffering—the bugbear of the universe. Suffering is not viewed as a virtue by Buddhists. Although it can be turned into one, it has no intrinsic spiritual value in itself.</paragraph><paragraph>Dharma speaks first and foremost about suffering not because it is a pessimistic, gloomy, faith but because a tiny amount of suffering can mar a great deal of happiness. Just as tiny microbes can bring down a whole body, so is suffering spoiling happiness everywhere. It is through a longing to bring happiness to people that dharma starts by targeting suffering. Spirituality which does not address life's chaos and pain can be likened to bringing delicious grapes to somebody sick but not providing them with the medicine to cure the sickness.</paragraph><paragraph><essential>The essence of the First Turning is contained in the famous <bold>Four Truths</bold> . The first two truths are a cause-and-result pair dealing with suffering. The final two truths are a cause-and-result pair dealing with freedom from suffering. We will explore them in more detail later in this module. Here is just a summary:</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>1. <bold>The first truth concerns suffering. It explores impermanence, suffering, voidness and no-self and outlines the Buddhist description of the cosmos</bold> and of the various life forms which inhabit it, describing in detail their suffering and happiness.</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>2. <bold>The second truth points to the causes of the sufferings in the worlds</bold> . Put simply, it says that by not recognising the true nature of mind, an illusion of persona develops. This leads to personal needs and desires, aversions, jealousy, pride etc. and these poison the mind and cause one to act in a way which harms others. Such actions ( <italic>karma</italic> ) generate suffering ( <italic>samsara</italic> ) later for their doer.</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>3. <bold>The third truth describes nirvana: the state wherein suffering is no more</bold> .</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential> <bold>4.</bold>  <bold>The fourth truth examines</bold> the causes of nirvana— <bold>the famous "path" of Buddhism, founded in right ethics and conduct, right meditation and right understanding.</bold> </essential></paragraph><paragraph>In this First Turning, we encounter the famous <bold>Middle Way</bold> as a description of the dharma path. At this stage, it is mainly presented as a way of life and of spiritual practice that avoids the extremes of over-indulgence and asceticism. This Middle Way was practised by the Buddha, after his earlier years spent first in utmost luxury and then in asceticism. The Middle Way also avoids the extremes of projections of soul <bold>(permanence) and negation</bold> (of karmic consequences).</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="The Second Turning" pagetitle="The Second Turning" tocentry="The Second Turning"><italic>The Second Turning</italic><paragraph>For many years, Buddha Sakyamuni taught the way out of suffering and to freedom from suffering. This involved a host of teachings, methods and the development of a precise language to analyse and describe the mind and the world. He next introduced the second phase of his teaching—to many (but not all) disciples; those who had sufficiently freed their minds and who were ripe for the next step. This phase is often associated with the caves of Vulture Peak in Rajgir <a href="#_ftn13">[11]</a>.</paragraph><paragraph><essential> <bold>The first phase emphasised the voidness of ego</bold> but described the world in a way that corresponded to the general perception of it as something existing in its own right. This <bold>second phase unveiled the voidness of absolutely everything</bold> inner <italic>and</italic> outer: people <italic>and</italic> their environment.</essential></paragraph><paragraph>Over the years of the First Turning, the Buddha had established a very complete scientific and psychological language, enabling all things material and mental to be clearly defined and distinguished. The extremely fine analysis of mind, in particular, was the key factor enabling illusions of personal reality to be understood and evaporated. The eighteen elements of consciousness, the five aggregates, the twelve gates of perception, the twelve links of interdependence, the fifty-one mental events, the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment: these and many other notions became the everyday language and working reality the Buddha's followers. These later became formalised as <italic>abhidharma</italic> .</paragraph><paragraph>In the Second Turning, the Buddha revealed all of those key components of mind and consciousness to be de <italic>void</italic> of any ultimate reality. Having previously shown his disciples how to dismantle the ego-illusion machine into its thousand cogs, he now showed them how even the cogs are illusions, being merely ideas. The second phase of his teachings is embodied in the <italic>prajnaparamita</italic> or Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom. Whereas the first phase spoke to everyone, the second phase only made sense to those capable of considerable spiritual maturity.</paragraph><paragraph><essential>In this second phase, the Buddha made the omnipresence of voidness perfectly clear. Its teachings dismantle all conceptual illusions of reality and even those of non-reality. However, they do not elucidate the actual nature of ultimate reality—the buddha mind—beyond the illusions—other than to point out what was absent.</essential></paragraph><paragraph>In the Second Turning, the <bold>Middle Way</bold> takes on a second and very profound meaning, as expounded by Nagarjuna in his Perfection of Wisdom texts: that of avoiding the four limits and the eight extremes. This will be explained in a later module.</paragraph><paragraph>As the deconstruction of all illusions is a powerful and delicate process, it requires outstanding compassion. This is needed for the work on oneself and for the way in which one regards other sentient beings. The keynote of the Second Phase is the omnipresence of compassion and the absolute need for compassion if one wishes to attain the Buddha's enlightenment.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="The Third Turning" pagetitle="The Third Turning" tocentry="The Third Turning"><italic>The Third Turning</italic><paragraph><essential>Once the meaning of voidness, as expounded in the second phase, was well comprehended, the third phase of the Buddha's teaching revealed the actual nature of ultimate voidness. This is not simply an <italic>absence</italic> of illusion. It is not <italic>merely an emptiness</italic> . It is not vast, virgin space. On the contrary, it is the total, perfect <italic>presence</italic> of the love, compassion, wisdom, powers and all the other qualities of enlightenment. It is an <italic>affirmation</italic> , as opposed to the <italic>negations</italic> of the other two "turnings". Most importantly, the Buddha taught that every single sentient being has this ultimate voidness as his, her or its true nature. Thus the Third Turning of the Wheel of Dharma teaches <italic>buddha nature</italic> , the fact that the wisdom and perfection of enlightenment is profoundly present in everyone, all the time.</essential></paragraph><paragraph>Following this, over the centuries, various learned and enlightened teachers wrote treaties— <italic>shastra</italic> —on <italic>buddha nature</italic> . Maitreya's work— <italic>the mahayana uttara tantra shastra</italic> , translated in English with commentary as "Maitreya on Buddha Nature" (see bibliography at end)—is the greatest of these classics. It is the reference for all the Tibetan traditions, as well as for Mahayana traditions in China, Korea and Japan.</paragraph><subsubsection title="A simple but effective introduction to the term &#34;voidness&#34;" pagetitle="A simple but effective introduction to the term &#34;voidness&#34;" tocentry="A simple but effective introduction to the term &#34;voidness&#34;">A simple but effective introduction to the term "voidness"<paragraph>The Sanskrit term <italic>shunyata</italic> translates as <italic>voidness</italic> or <italic>emptiness</italic> . Both English words, and particularly the latter, conjure up visions of hollow, empty space. To hear of someone "meditating in voidness" conjures up images of absorption in vast, silent, cosmic spaces. However, such notions do not at all convey the real meaning of the term <italic>shunyata,</italic> which describe a clarity, a wisdom, an awareness that pierces through mind's illusions. It is called <italic>voidness</italic> because it sees the illusions as being "null-and-void"; devoid of the reality they seem to have had.</paragraph><paragraph>Let us take, for example, the phrase <italic>the voidness of ego—</italic> something taught in all traditions of Buddhism. This is not talking about some quality of ego, in the same way one might speak about <italic>the sweetness of this cake</italic> . It is not saying that ego <italic>exists</italic> but that somehow it is spacious and open. The teachings show us that ego only exists as an illusion: some thing imagined. That illusion does not correspond to reality. We can imagine Mount Fujiyama in the centre of Paris but when we check it out, no Mount Fuji is found there. Hence, investigation shows mind's imaginary projections of "I" and "me" to be null-and-void. Realising the voidness our projections, illusions, delusions etc. is the heart of Buddhist wisdom. We could say, "Realisation of voidness is wisdom" but this is usually shortened to <italic>voidness is wisdom</italic> .</paragraph><paragraph><essential> <bold> <italic>Voidness</italic> </bold>  <bold>means <italic>wisdom</italic> </bold>: very profound wisdom that sees through the habitual illusions. It sees them to be de <italic>void</italic> of <a href="#_ftn14">[12]</a>the reality they seem to have.</essential></paragraph><paragraph>To look at a mirage but <underline>know</underline> that there is no water really present on the horizon is a simple form of voidness-wisdom. Wisdom understands the movements of light and knows what is happening. It informs us that there is no water, even though the eyes tell us otherwise. The "voidness" of what seems to be a distant shimmering lake is the wisdom in the mind of the watcher, no longer tricked by delusion. But note, this wisdom does not in any way make the mirage disappear. The optical effect continues exactly as before but now that it is accompanied by wisdom, one's appreciation of what is there is different. It saves an awful lot of useless trudging across the sand, to assuage a thirst!</paragraph><paragraph><essential>In another way, voidness is very much to do with limitlessness. It is the wisdom of an unlimited, free mind that is not deluded by one or another limited view.</essential></paragraph><paragraph>Once the limiting illusion goes, there is usually a limitlessness. For instance, the idea of a single, lasting self—some monolithic identity that lasts a lifetime—is dissolved in Buddhism by a fine analysis of what a human being really is—an infinitely complex, stream of components, the consciousness of which changes every split-second.</paragraph><paragraph>Furthermore, any person's experience of a specific thing is necessarily <underline>dependent</underline> upon many <underline>limiting</underline> factors. Humans see what humans see and hear what humans hear. Dogs or bats hear things we cannot. Our senses are very limited. The messages conveyed to the brain by the senses are severely filtered and then immediately linked with memories which colour the perception. And so on and so forth. Each of us has a unique and <underline>highly subjective</underline> appreciation of reality. Yet in each person's mind, <bold>that appreciation seems to be reality itself and is taken as such</bold> .</paragraph><paragraph>This perception of reality is heavily coloured by past karma. Three people in the same place can find it heaven, hell or indifferent respectively, depending upon the state of their mind. The state of mind is the consequence of past karma. A man with rare and expensive fish in his pond may look at them with great pride and see them primarily as a beautiful possession. A passing heron may view them as food. Another species of fish may jealously consider it as ugly; not beautiful at all. The fish will feel like itself, neither a possession nor a meal. A worm in the fish's stomach may just experience it as warmth and a certain smell. A passing deva may see the fish as a n ~ ga. A neurotic spirit may see it as a vicious sea-serpent. Which one is the real fish?</paragraph><paragraph>Any thing is infinitely more than simply the limited impression of it which a sentient being perceive. Its infinite possibilities, and actualities, render void our feeling that the thing <italic>is only</italic> what we at first perceive it to be.</paragraph><paragraph><essential>Voidness means the wisdom that recognises the difference between what <italic>seems to be</italic> and what <italic>really is</italic> . That "really is" cannot be just a different limited impression, an alternative mental definition, another finite idea. It has to be infinite.</essential></paragraph><paragraph>It is by applying the wisdom of voidness—as the piercing of illusions—that:</paragraph><paragraph><essential>· The First Turning teachings destroy delusions (projections) of self.</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>· The Second Turning destroys projections of concrete reality and thereby stimulates great compassion for those still deluded and</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>· The Third Turning removes delusions about voidness itself and reveals authentic reality as the changeless, eternal awakened (buddha) mind</essential></paragraph></subsubsection></subsection></section><section index="4" title="The Dharma After the Buddha's Passing" pagetitle="The Dharma After the Buddha's Passing" tocentry="The Dharma After the Buddha's Passing"><subsection title="The Dharma After the Buddha's Passing" pagetitle="The Dharma After the Buddha's Passing" tocentry="The Dharma After the Buddha's Passing"><image width="479" src="module2_files.image005.png" align=""/><paragraph>In a later module, we will look in more detail into the development of dharma in India and Tibet.

There were several major meetings of the sangha to discuss and determine the exact content of the Buddha's teachings. They are known as <italic>Councils</italic>:</paragraph><list kind="ol"><item>The First Council, held three months after the Buddha's passing, i.e. 544 BCE [13]</item><item>The Second Council, held approximately a century after the Buddha's passing.</item><item>The Third Council in 250 BCE.</item><item>The Fourth Councils, one (recognised by Theravadins) in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE and another (recognised by Mahayanists) in North-West India around 100 CE.</item></list><subsubsection title="The First Council" pagetitle="The First Council" tocentry="The First Council"><image width="212" src="module2_files.image006.png" align="left"/>The First Council<paragraph>This was convened by the elder Mahakasyapa and sponsored by the king Ajatashatru, who erected a building in front of the Sattapanni cave in Rajgir (right, Bihar state, India). It took place three months after the Buddha's passing, due to Mahakasyapa's concerns about the monastic discipline ( <italic>vinaya</italic> ) crumbling if it were not properly codified. It was attended by 500 fully-liberated monks ( <italic>Arhants</italic> ). Under the guidance of the greatest expert on vinaya at the time—Upali, who received the direct transmission of vinaya from the Buddha—the rules for lay and monastic Buddhists were established.</paragraph><paragraph>Under the Buddha's cousin, Ananda—who of all the sangha had accompanied and served the Buddha the longest and who had the gift of total recall—the general teachings the dharma were established. Nothing was written down but the <italic>vinaya</italic> and <italic>dharma</italic> were learnt by heart. Together they took seven months to be recited, beginning to end.</paragraph></subsubsection><subsubsection title="The Second Council" pagetitle="The Second Council" tocentry="The Second Council">The Second Council<paragraph>This took place in Vesali, also in Bihar. It was to settle a hot dispute which grew up concerning the minor rules for monastics. It was also to do with flexibility and the question of which minor rules the Buddha had considered dispensable, in certain circumstances. The main question was about whether monks or nuns could carry money. The outcome was a decision to stick strictly to all the minor rules.</paragraph></subsubsection><subsubsection title="The Third Council" pagetitle="The Third Council" tocentry="The Third Council">The Third Council<paragraph>This Council is only mentioned in the Theravadin tradition. It was convened in 250 BCE under the great emperor Ashoka, the first king to unite much of India. He had converted to Buddhism and his brother had attained arhantship. His extraordinary generosity to Buddhism (he is said to have constructed 84,000 Buddhist temples and monastic dwellings) led to corrupt people donning robes and exploiting the system. This council was convened to deal with corruption issues arising from this. One of the great outcomes of Ashoka's reign, and arguably of this council, was the sending forth of great Buddhist masters (those who knew the dharma thoroughly by heart) to foreign countries, including Greece <a href="#_ftn16">[14]</a>, many Himalayan kingdoms and what are now Sri Lanka and Myanmar. The Theravadins hold that some things were written down at this time, in a text called the <italic>Katthavattu</italic> , in twenty-three chapters discussing issues raised during the Council.</paragraph></subsubsection><subsubsection title="The Sri Lankan Fourth Council" pagetitle="The Sri Lankan Fourth Council" tocentry="The Sri Lankan Fourth Council">The Sri Lankan Fourth Council<paragraph>This was held in Tambapanni, Sri Lanka, in 29 BCE under the patronage of King Vattagamani and lasted for three years. Severe loss of life, due to drought in Sri Lanka, had threatened the continuity of the oral tradition by which the Buddha's teachings had been remembered and passed down for some five centuries. It was decided to commit the teachings to writing and this gave the world the famous Pali <a href="#_ftn17">[15]</a>Canon, the earliest Buddhist scriptures, written on palm leaves, held together by string to make books. Copies of these were taken to other Buddhist countries, such as Myanmar, Laos and Thailand.</paragraph><paragraph>  </paragraph></subsubsection><subsubsection title="The Indian Fourth Council" pagetitle="The Indian Fourth Council" tocentry="The Indian Fourth Council">The Indian Fourth Council<paragraph>This was convened by the Kushan emperor Kanishka, either in Jallandar <a href="#_ftn18">[16]</a>or in nearby Kashmir. Although various abhidharma lineages had appeared by this time, it was during this council that ideas <a href="#_ftn19">[17]</a>concerning <italic>abhidharma</italic> (the Buddhist science of mind and matter) were codified by a team of five hundred scholars under the guidance of a certain Vasumitra. This is recounted in early Mahayana texts, describing the Sarvastivadin refutations of abhidharma as codified in the Great Discourse ( <italic>Mahavibasha</italic> ). Sarvastivadin does not exist today as an indepndent school but its ideas on abhidharma were taken up by Mahayana schools. The codification is said to have taken twelve years, covering three hundred thousand verses and some nine million statements.</paragraph><paragraph>It also seems that this was a defining moment in language, as the early Prakrit (vernacular) texts were rendered into Sanskrit from then on. Sanskrit had been a "high" language reserved for Brahmins at the time of the Buddha, who had insisted that teachings be given in local, common, dialects so as to be accessible to all. Now, some six centuries later and in a much-changed society, Sanskrit was seen by Mahayanists to be the best vehicle for writing down the ancient instructions. Theravadins stuck by the original ruling from the Buddha and maintained their scriptures in the commoners' Pali.</paragraph></subsubsection></subsection><subsection title="The Development of Mahayana" pagetitle="The Development of Mahayana" tocentry="The Development of Mahayana"><italic>The Development of Mahayana</italic><paragraph>The truth is that little is known for sure of the history of this. We will consider Indian Buddhist history and its main teachers in a later module. Here are some key points:</paragraph><list kind="ul"><item>Mahayanists themselves see their teachings as going right back to the historical Buddha and believe in the Three Turnings, as explained above. Theravadins do not agree. They only accept the First Turning and see Mahayanists as breakaway groups wanting to add their own interpretations and developments to the original teachings.</item><item>The earliest Mahayana writings appeared between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE. These include such famous works as the Perfection of Wisdom ( prajnaparamita ), Lotus Sutra, Nirvana Sutra etc. Mahayanists believe that the Buddha gave these teachings during his lifetime, in places such as the Vulture Peak at Rajgir, and that many of the Buddha's followers were either not ready for them—and so were led elsewhere by their karma when the teachings were given—or else thought they had already heard everything to be heard from the Buddha and so excused themselves when he started to teach them. [18]Until they were written down, they were either preserved as an oral tradition or else secreted away, in writing, in other realms, such as the Perfection of Wisdom texts, guarded for some six centuries by naga serpent spirits and recovered by Nagarjuna.</item><item>Mahayana became dominant in India from the 5th to the 10th centuries CE.</item><item>The two immensely-important Buddhist masters whose own writings and whose disciples' writings give us the main content of Mahayana were Nagarjuna and Asanga.</item><item>Nagarjuna was born in either the 1st or 2nd century CE. The Mahayana tradition stemming from him is known as "the deep one" and he is famous for his extensive explanations of the Perfection of Wisdom.</item><item>Asanga was born around 300 CE. The tradition stemming from him is known as "the vast one", as his five great shastra give much detailed information about the path.</item></list><paragraph>  </paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Vajrayana Buddhism" pagetitle="Vajrayana Buddhism" tocentry="Vajrayana Buddhism"><italic>Vajrayana Buddhism</italic><paragraph>We will explore Vajrayana Buddhism in much more detail in the third study year. For now, here are some key points:</paragraph><list kind="ul"><item>It means the way, or vehicle, ( yana ) of that which is indestructible ( vajra ). This refers to the timeless, perfect, indestructible buddha mind, or buddha nature. The vajrayana teachings help one connect with that in the present moment. It is also called tantra , which means "thread" in Sanskrit. This refers to the continuous, unbroken, thread of buddha mind which accompanies the deluded mind every second, throughout the illusion of samsara, yet remains unrecognised. The point of these teachings is to recognise it.</item><item>Tibetan masters say that some vajrayana lineages started at the time of Sakyamuni Buddha, principally the instructions he gave to King Indrabhuti.</item><item>The first vajrayana texts appeared around the 5th century CE but vajrayana had doubtless existed as a highly-secret, oral tradition, practised in forests and mountains by small groups of yogis for many centuries before it entered the monasteries, where its teachings became "tamer" and integrated with the monastic round, giving rise to the texts. It is likely that there was already a thriving vajrayana at the time of Asanga, since we know that his epoch was a time of opening for the monasteries. It seems to have become more common for the studious monks to go off to the jungles and for great siddhas [19]to be invited to teach in monasteries.</item><item>The vajrayana flourished in India from the 7th through to 12th centuries in India. After that time, most Buddhist traditions disappeared, due to a violent rise of foreign Islamic invasions and local Hinduism.</item><item>Vajrayana went to Tibet in two great waves: the ancient transmission (Nyingma) in the 8th century, with Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava) and the other during the 11th and early 12th centuries with the founders of the "new traditions" (Sarma). Eight great traditions were transported to Tibet by both Indian and Tibetan masters. They are known as the Eight Great Chariots.</item></list><subsubsection title="&#34;Tibetan Buddhism&#34;" pagetitle="&#34;Tibetan Buddhism&#34;" tocentry="&#34;Tibetan Buddhism&#34;">"Tibetan Buddhism"<paragraph>This term makes a lot of superficial sense—as we compare it with Japanese or Thai Buddhism— but it also makes it sound as though Tibet developed its own Buddhism, which is not really the case. From the 8th through to 12th centuries CE, both Tibetan and Indian masters transplanted the <underline>Indian Buddhism</underline> of that period across the Himalaya to Tibet, in a very complete way. Tibet received the broadest, most comprehensive "package" of Buddhism—more than any other country. In the wealth of its literature and techniques, one finds the overall picture of what otherwise is found only in parts other countries. It was the only country to preserve a living wealth of vajrayana.</paragraph></subsubsection><subsubsection title="Conclusion" pagetitle="Conclusion" tocentry="Conclusion">Conclusion<paragraph>The way in which our lamas tend to view the development of dharma in India, from the time of <italic>nirmanakaya</italic> Buddha Sakyamuni until its disappearance in the 13th century, 1800 years later, is as follows. The Buddha Sakyamuni taught all levels during his lifetime: Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana. The Mahayana and Vajrayana continued as secret traditions until this world was ready for them to be spread at large. As that happened, the <italic>sambhogakaya</italic> buddha-mind either emanated as great teachers or else directly inspired great teachers, who composed the various Mahayana shastras and the tantras.</paragraph><paragraph>If we consider this cosmically, rather than historically, the universe is vast and multi-dimensional. The pure buddha mind is the constant backdrop to its ever-changing fabric. Whenever someone is truly ready, for whichever level of teaching it be, that buddha mind will appear in their existence, guiding and teaching them.</paragraph><paragraph>  </paragraph><paragraph>  </paragraph></subsubsection><subsubsection title="Sutra and Shastra" pagetitle="Sutra and Shastra" tocentry="Sutra and Shastra">Sutra and Shastra<paragraph>During his forty-five years of teaching, the Buddha gave many detailed explanations about all sorts of topics. These were mostly taught in response to questions, in this place or that place, sometimes simply and sometimes profoundly. Everything recorded of the Buddha's own teachings fills over one hundred thick volumes of Tibetan scripture, in a collection known as the <bold> <italic>Kanjur</italic> </bold> ( <italic>bka 'gyur</italic> ), which means "Sacred Instruction Translated". If we take a typical topic—such as karma—we will find various teachings on it scattered throughout the hundred volumes.</paragraph><paragraph>Therefore we can understand the value of the tremendous work accomplished by the greatest Buddhist masters, such as Nagarjuna, Asanga and their disciples, in compiling information on key topics and presenting it to us as a coherent whole. They themselves had encyclopaedic understanding of the Kanjur and had clear, enlightened minds. The works they composed were not commentaries properly-speaking, on the Buddha's teachings, as a commentary usually takes original verses and elaborates on them, word by word, meaning by meaning. They were brilliant analytical presentations. We call them <italic>shastra</italic> and call the Buddha's own teachings <italic>sutra</italic> . The traditional collection of the great <italic>shastra</italic> in Tibetan translation is known as the <bold> <italic>Tenjur</italic> </bold> ( <italic>bstan 'gyur</italic> ), meaning "shastras translated". It has more than two hundred volumes.</paragraph><table class="MsoNormalTable"><tbody><tr><td> <bold> <italic>Buddhas in Buddhist Art</italic> </bold> It is interesting to note that the historical Buddha Sakyamuni was not represented by statues or paintings until at least four centuries after his passing, when the influence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhist_art">Greco-Buddhist art</a>and the Gandhara style swept across Buddhist Asia, bringing a whole new iconography.

He actually taught two other people—the laymen merchants Tapussu and Bhalluka — before meeting up again with the group of five, so the latter were not technically the first disciples but they were the first to become monks. The earliest texts do not mention the Dharmachakra Sutra as such but say that the Buddha would teach some of the five disciples while the others went off to beg for food for the six of them.

It was taught at length and in detail by the Enlightened One to a general public. Its teachings are recognised and practised by almost all schools of Buddhism. They deal practically with tangible things: life at it is, the mind as we can observe it and they expound a set of "natural ethics" based upon respect for life and non-violence, generosity of spirit and self-mastery. The main focus is on the reduction and eventually the total elimination of suffering. This first turning addresses two sorts of audience through its two aspects of truth:</paragraph><list kind="ol"><item>The relative truth aspect of its teachings outlines the processes of cause-and-effect which weave the very fabric of existence. They show how a person's actions ( karma ) will determine their happiness or suffering in future lives. The wholesome acts, known as "virtue", generate happiness. "Non-virtue" generates suffering.

In fact, it means what will go on endlessly, as a sort of self-perpetuating mechanism, unless something is done to stop it. It refers to the ignorance, confusion, illusions and other harmful things in the mind, which lead into ego-centred realities. There is the struggle for affection, recognition and companionship; the sexual drive; the wish for power and there is also a habitual self-centredness and fear which stifles altruism. All of those things (and many others which we will look at in next month's module) cause us to <underline>act</underline> . Action, in Sanskrit, is <italic>karma</italic> .</paragraph><paragraph>According to the Buddha's teachings, what we do now—the <italic>karma</italic> we create now—determines what will become of us in the future and in future lives. What we are now, and the world as we experience it, each uniquely, is the result of what we did in the past.</paragraph><paragraph>The crucial point is this: no one <italic>wants</italic> to suffer, people want happiness. The problem is ignorance, because in trying to find happiness, people create sufferings they never intended. They create suffering for others, in the short term, and for themselves in the long term, through the play of karma. They simply do not know enough about life's immutable causal mechanisms or about the nature of change: impermanence. There is a further level to add to this: each person's samsara is a very sorry sate of affairs compared with how their mind could be, if only they knew what was possible. The price of fleeting happiness in this world is disproportional and almost always entails considerable suffering. All the Buddha's life and teachings are about reducing and getting rid of this unnecessary suffering forever.</paragraph><paragraph>Of course, there are many wholesome, useful things in the mind too: a sense of ethics, selfless generosity, love of truth etc. These are not a problem. The guideline is this: <underline>whatever has the "I" thought at its heart leads to a perpetuation of samsara and hence to suffering</underline> .</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="A classical approach to the truth of suffering" pagetitle="A classical approach to the truth of suffering" tocentry="A classical approach to the truth of suffering"><italic>A classical approach to the truth of suffering</italic><paragraph>In the more technical treatises on the Four Truths, each truth is developed through four key topics, making sixteen in all <a href="#_ftn24">[22]</a>. These are especially important in Theravada Buddhism, as it is realisation of these which constitutes the insight aspect of their enlightenment. The key topics for this First Truth are:</paragraph><list kind="ol"><item>Impermanence.</item><item>Suffering itself.</item><item>Voidness.</item><item>No-self.</item></list><paragraph> <bold> <italic>Impermanence</italic> </bold> , explained briefly here, will be developed in detail in Module 9. It is defined as being the instability that is the very nature of any <italic>composite phenomenon</italic> , i.e. <underline>anything</underline> that arises due to the coming-together of prime causes and secondary conditions. Based on the famous saying found in the <italic>Collection of Aphorisms,</italic> Gampopa sums it up:</paragraph><paragraph>What is accumulated will eventually dwindle, what is built up will eventually disintegrate, what comes together eventually will part and what lives eventually will die.</paragraph><paragraph> <bold> <italic>Suffering</italic> </bold>  <italic>—</italic> in its three aspects and in terms of its manifestation in the six realms—will be developed immediately below in considerable detail <italic>.</italic> The suffering of samsara is defined as an inability to satisfy and an unexpected sting <a href="#_ftn25">[23]</a>. Here, we will connect it with the previous point, impermanence. Everything changes. Nothing lasts. Thus, whenever someone clings—to health, youth, beauty, their parents, children, status, reputation, lovers or whatever impermanent thing gives them happiness—there will be suffering when that person or thing changes or disappears. The more one clings, the more there is suffering through the pain of loss. Furthermore, much harmful karma is created in trying to resist inevitable change.</paragraph><paragraph> <bold> <italic>Voidness</italic> </bold> is defined as the actual true nature of the illusory things through which one suffers. In its simplest and most universal explanation of this point, the people and things through which one suffers are demonstrated to be, on an absolute level, no more than a momentary concatenation of atoms. What we perceive is a gross, very partial, frozen image based on the dance of those atoms.</paragraph><paragraph> <bold> <italic>No-self</italic> </bold> is defined similarly to the above but is related to the perceiving mind; the illusory, suffering mind. On a level of absolute truth, there is no sufferer but merely a sequence of separate moments of consciousness. The frames of a cinema film are each an individual image yet when they run one after another they give an impression of a single, lasting reality. Likewise, the split-second moments of minds consciousness, cognition and so forth give the impression of a lasting self, of a "person" who suffers. No such self can ever be found.</paragraph><paragraph>These two topics of voidness and no-self will be developed Module 4.</paragraph><paragraph>  </paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Three levels of suffering" pagetitle="Three levels of suffering" tocentry="Three levels of suffering"><italic>Three levels of suffering</italic><paragraph><essential>This topic is very important, as it reveals why suffering is at the heart of Buddhist teaching. In dharma, "suffering" is not restricted to the physical and mental difficulties that the word at first suggests.</essential></paragraph><list kind="ol"><item><essential> <bold>Suffering as suffering</bold>: this is when mind or body or both feel pain. It is the obvious suffering and usually the only sort of suffering people think of when they hear the word "suffering".</essential></item><item><essential> <bold>Suffering through change</bold>: besides the suffering through impermanence described in the previous section, there is a major aspect of suffering through change that is related to karma and ignorance. To the uninformed eye, it does not look like suffering. In fact, it often appears like someone having a good time. However, the very things that are being done, to have that "good time", are setting in motion mechanisms of suffering. An extreme example would be someone enjoying hurting another being, like a hunter enjoying a day in the forest shooting deer. In that particular case, it may be the highlight of the person's week: their greatest happiness and something to really look forward to. Yet, through the inevitable cosmic laws of cause-and-effect, taught by the Buddha, we know that the hunter will be reborn to suffer tremendously, physically, on account of such acts. The sufferings will be immeasurably greater than the fleeting moments of pleasure enjoyed while shooting. Many everyday actions that people perform—from spraying the bugs on their roses to cheating the taxman—fall into this category, which can be defined as creating the karma of suffering through actions intended to bring pleasure or to combat the unpleasant.</essential></item><item><essential> <bold>Suffering of the Composite</bold> . This third stage of suffering is only known to very pure beings. From the beauty, liberation, wisdom, peace and innate, selfless love of their state of mind, the whole of regular existence—even when it is at its best—is a dark, limited state of affairs. Such noble beings, <italic>arya</italic> , see that to ignore the liberated state is in itself a tremendous suffering.</essential></item></list><paragraph>These three are linked. Through <italic>the suffering of the composite</italic> , we ignore how happy, free and wise the mind is in its natural, uncontrived state. We get involved in all sorts of ventures and situations, in an attempt to find happiness for ourselves, but due to the <italic>suffering through change</italic> , our ignorance of cause-and-effect means that often our attempts to find happiness are triggering unhappiness for the future. When that future comes, there is <italic>suffering as suffering</italic> . Therefore the scriptures compare samsara to poisoned rice. By its very nature, it is poisoned. Not knowing this, one eats it and finds it delicious and nourishing. But because of the poison, one later falls ill and writhes in agony.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="A Buddhist survey of the cosmos" pagetitle="A Buddhist survey of the cosmos" tocentry="A Buddhist survey of the cosmos"><italic>A Buddhist survey of the cosmos</italic><paragraph>The way in which the Truth of Suffering is presented is as a survey of the different worlds of existence and a sort of balance-sheet describing the life-conditions, joys, sufferings, faculties and life-spans of the various beings. The Buddha taught about the cosmos itself differently according to the audience. In general, we have three versions <a href="#_ftn26">[24]</a>:</paragraph><list kind="ol"><item>The common-people's version, based on the way in which the people at the time of the Buddha believed the world to be [25]. This was a widespread Indo-European world view which had probably reached India in the second millennium BCE. It was a world-centred view of the cosmos, based upon a central mountain, with the realms of the gods stacked one above another in the sky above and with the infernal realms in the volcanic lava beneath the earth. The stars and planets revolved around the world in the sky above.</item><item>The universal view often found in Mahayana texts. It consists of inhabited universes, each made of a billion world-systems similar to the one mentioned above. In fact, it is a thousand sets of worlds made of a thousand sets of worlds each made of a thousand sets of such worlds. You will find such a universe described as a gigacosmos or trichiliocosm in translations.</item><item>A mind-based view of the cosmos, in which there are as many "worlds" as there are sentient beings and these worlds could be absolutely anything, as could their beings. One finds this in the tantras, such as the Kalachakra Tantra, where it says that how other beings may possibly be defies our imagination.</item></list></subsection><subsection title="The six categories, or &#34;Six Realms&#34;, of beings" pagetitle="The six categories, or &#34;Six Realms&#34;, of beings" tocentry="The six categories, or &#34;Six Realms&#34;, of beings"><italic>The six categories, or "Six Realms", of beings</italic><paragraph>We only have to look around here on Earth, on land or in the oceans or through a microscope, to appreciate the almost limitless and breath-taking variety of living beings, not to mention those which might exist elsewhere. Mahayana Buddhism, while recognising an endless number of types of being, discerns six major categories, known as the "six realms of samsara". There is a tendency these days among certain Buddhist teachers to take these solely as a metaphor for the range of different experiences of the human psyche. Although that is very useful, as a tool for understanding our human minds and human karma, our greatest contemporary masters say beyond any doubt that the Buddha taught these as actual states of being into which one can be reborn. Of the six, most humans only experience two; those of other humans and animals. The existence of the remaining four has to be taken on trust: trust of the Buddha's own teachings and trust of the experience of other realms which arises in the clear meditations of accomplished Buddhist masters.</paragraph><paragraph>In Hinayana Buddhism, mind and matter are different and the various realms have "geographical" existence. The locations are mentioned in each section below. In Mahayana Buddhism, everything is mind and hence the question as to whether hells exist as real places or not becomes redundant. In this respect, please note Gampopa's comments about the hells, at the end of that section.</paragraph><paragraph><essential>The six realms fall into two groups:</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>1. The <bold>upper realms</bold> —of gods, demi-gods and humans—where there is a relatively good rebirth and some degree of happiness, albeit transient.</essential></paragraph><paragraph><essential>2. The <bold>lower realms</bold> —of animals, spirits and hell-beings—which are generally unfortunate rebirths and where suffering dominates.</essential></paragraph><paragraph>All is not clear-cut. There are many borderline cases and stories of mixed karma. For instance, a pampered pet dog may be materially much better-off than a human living in a place of extreme famine and war. These are general categories only, established with a particular view to help us understand the major results of karma. For a fairly full description of these states, you are recommended to read the "suffering" chapter in Gampopa's "Gems of Dharma, Jewels of Freedom". What follows is a resumé.</paragraph><subsubsection title="The Upper Realms" pagetitle="The Upper Realms" tocentry="The Upper Realms">The Upper Realms<paragraph>The upper realms are characterised by the relative ease of their circumstances <bold>yet</bold> there is always some suffering present and none of these states lasts indefinitely: a human life, for instance, is not that long. There is also the suffering of change. The upper realms all belong to samsara, and hence there is always the suffering of the composite. These relatively fortunate states represent good rebirth resulting from previous virtuous karma. Their duration—or the number of times one may be reborn in them—depends upon the quality and quantity of virtuous karma.</paragraph>1. The Gods<paragraph>The god realms are as good—in material terms—as samsara gets. Gods' bodies (some have bodies of light) and the realms in which they live, not to mention the joy and harmony between them, are for the most part delightful, although some gods have a wicked side. These godly—of if we use the Sanskrit word <italic>deva</italic> — existences occur as a result of strong and virtuous karma in previous lives. There are three main categories of gods:</paragraph><list kind="ol"><item> Sense-dimension gods . As the name suggests, their worlds are sensorial, filled with visual beauty, pleasant sounds, pleasant companions and consorts etc. These result from former powerful practice of generosity, pure conduct and forbearance. These actions, accomplished in what appears to the realms of the senses, bring joyful sensorial results. There are six main levels of these gods [26]</item><item> Form-dimension gods. These are rebirth-states in which the experience is not of sensorial beauty but of meditative absorption. It is very long-lasting and uninterrupted and produced by virtue and prowess in similar meditations when human. There are four main categories with seventeen sub-categories, of which only the first twelve belong to samsara . The others are only accessible to beings who have gone beyond individuality and rebirth.</item><item> Formless gods. These are rebirths into a state on ongoing formless meditation, produced by the impetus of mastery of formless meditation whilst human. There are four levels.</item></list><paragraph>Thus, altogether, there are twenty-seven levels of gods of which twenty-two fall within samsara.</paragraph><paragraph>The <bold>sufferings</bold> of the gods are those of having to protect their vast possessions and to fend off the attacks of the jealous demi-gods (see below), of dissatisfaction due to unsatiated desires but principally those of decline and fall, when their karma to remain in the god realms eventually runs out. They have become so accustomed to the beauty or the purity of their realms, and to all the power and possibilities associated with their state, that the pain of losing it all is unbearable. They have considerable clairvoyance and foresee their coming rebirth long before it happens. This prospect is overwhelmingly sad and unbelievable, as their pride, which in this context means "taking for granted" (see below) finds it so hard to accept that there can be no other outcome but a fall into a much, much worse state, often, as it happens, the lower realms.</paragraph><paragraph>The <bold>defining characteristic</bold> of the god realms is <bold>pride</bold> . This can be taken to mean arrogance and haughtiness but it often has a much broader meaning of "identifying with being on top" <a href="#_ftn29">[27]</a>. The gods are where they are through their good karma but rather than understanding their condition to be a transient moment of good fortune, they feel that it is "their place", "their right", forever. We could take the example of a person born a billionaire in our world, who would find it completely natural to be flown around in a private jet, to have a home filled afresh with expensive flowers every day and so on and so forth, even though others are penniless. It feels natural - to him! Thus, there is presumption and complacency.</paragraph><paragraph>It was the combination of pride with good karma which caused gods to be reborn as they are and that is why it is important for us, as we create virtue, to remain humble and to dedicate it to a useful rebirth, preferably as a human.</paragraph><paragraph>Another defining characteristic of the gods is <bold>spiritual laziness</bold> . This is a direct consequence of their pride and the feeling that things will always be that good. There is not the stimulation of experiencing suffering, either in themselves or the world around them, to trigger the compassion which is the keynote of spirituality. When they do start to suffer, as they see their forthcoming nemesis, they are too filled with fear and self-pity to give space to spirituality.</paragraph><paragraph>Compared to humans, gods live for extremely long periods of time, although their own perception of time is different from ours.</paragraph>2. The Demi-gods<paragraph>These have a fair degree of good karma and are reborn in proximity to the deva realms and in states of relative ease. However, their states are not as rich, or resplendent, as those of the true gods. Their possible pleasure is marred by their <bold>jealousy</bold> , which is their <bold>defining characteristic</bold> . Jealous of their neighbour gods, they set out in battle to appropriate the gods' riches. However, they themselves lack the karma to possess those riches and as the gods have greater strength, they inevitably lose their struggles. Thus the sufferings of the demi-gods are principally those of the inner torment of not being able to accept their limited good fortune and of being burnt by jealousy, along with the outer torment of undergoing humiliating injury and defeats.</paragraph><paragraph>They share a similar perception of time to that of the gods.</paragraph>3. Humans<paragraph>A human birth is considered the finest, as far as spiritual potential goes. It has just enough suffering to stimulate compassion. It is relatively short, so there is an impetus to prioritise spirituality. It has enough freedom—in terms of time, resources and so on—for someone to actually be dedicated to dharma. The <bold>defining characteristic</bold> of humans is <bold>desire</bold> and hence <bold>busyness</bold> in order to fulfil the desires.</paragraph><paragraph><essential>All human life is subject to the following four sufferings:</essential></paragraph><list kind="ol"><item><essential>Birth.</essential></item><item><essential>Ageing.</essential></item><item><essential>Sickness.</essential></item><item><essential>Death.</essential></item></list><paragraph><essential>And nearly all human life has the following four other sufferings:</essential></paragraph><list kind="ol"><item><essential>Separation from the people and things one loves.</essential></item><item><essential>Encountering what is unpleasant.</essential></item><item><essential>Striving to get what one needs and</essential></item><item><essential> Striving to maintain what one has.</essential></item></list><paragraph>As this realm is of direct concern to us, as humans, let us examine the first four in more detail.</paragraph><list kind="ol"><item> "Birth" covers the whole period from the experiences of the "in-between-lives" state [28], through conception, time in the womb and the helpless period when one is a dependant baby. The latter could arguably be extended into teenage years or to whichever time one can actually take control of one's own existence. This whole period of "birth" is governed by helplessness and unavoidable experience. The bardo is like a wild dream in which one is flung here and there, from one crazy experience to another. It ends with a series of powerful experiences, heralding conception and the future life. These experiences and the various stages of experience in the dark confines of the womb, once conception has taken place, are vividly described in Gampopa. Once born, one is unable to speak, take care of oneself and so forth and is dependent upon others for everything. Without any choice in the matter, for better or for worse, one acquires the habits and attitudes of the family and culture into which one has been born.</item></list><list kind="ol"><item> Ageing is not simply old-age, although that is the most vivid stage of the process. It is the loss of abilities and faculties which starts already in one's twenties (the ancient vajrayana texts recognised this and talk of a gradual decline from very early on). Some of the things affected, mentioned in Gampopa, are: strength, hair, skin, complexion, physical ability, sense faculties, prestige, quality of life, health and mental ability.</item></list><list kind="ol"><item> Sickness is vividly depicted by Milarepa, who describes it as being "like a tiny bird smitten by slingshot in mid flight". Most of us are aware of the suffering of physical or mental sickness. Gampopa highlights: being actually hit by the disease, having to undergo medical procedures and examinations, having to take strong medicines, being prevented from eating and drinking what one likes or doing things one likes to do, having to follow doctor's orders, fear of death and the effect it has on one's work and fortune.</item></list><list kind="ol"><item> Death is described vividly in the following extract from a sutra taught to a monarch. "Great King! When, like this, one has been tormented on the torture spike of death, one is no longer so arrogant. One is without protectors, allies or friend. Stricken by disease, the mouth is thirsty, one's face changes, the limbs give way, one is unable to work and filthies one's body with saliva, snot, urine and disgusting vomit and wheezes noisily. The doctors abandon hope, one sleeps on one's bed for the last time, sinks into the stream of samsara and becomes frightened of the Lord of Death's emissaries. The breathing stops, the mouth and nostrils gape. One leaves behind this world and heads for the next. It is the great departure, the entrance into deepest darkness, the fall over the greatest precipice and the mighty ocean sweeping one away. Borne away by the wind of karma, one goes to the place of no settling and this without being able to take one iota of one's possessions. Though one cries out Oh, mother! Oh father! Oh my children!, there is, at that time, great king, no other protector, no other refuge, no other ally, than dharma."</item></list></subsubsection><subsubsection title="The Three Lower Realms" pagetitle="The Three Lower Realms" tocentry="The Three Lower Realms">The Three Lower Realms<paragraph>The lower realms are the more painful end of samsara, in general representing unfortunate rebirth due to past non-virtuous karma. Besides the specific sufferings of each state, there is also the fact that the mind of a being in those states is so preoccupied with its own condition, often pain, that there is not the "space" for dharma.</paragraph>1. Animals<paragraph>These are defined either by their habitat (land, sea or air), or by the numbers of their legs <a href="#_ftn31">[29]</a>or else by their servitude (domestic animals, wild animals). Today we take for granted our vast knowledge of the animal world brought about by technological advance. It is quite extraordinary that thousands of years ago, the texts already clearly stated that by far and away the greatest majority of animals live in the oceans, in endless variety, eating one another ... and how so many were too small to be seen with the naked eye.</paragraph><paragraph>The main physical sufferings of the animals are those connected to survival itself: finding food, coping with the elements and avoiding predators. It is said that many of them live in constant fear for their lives. Domesticated animals have to suffer what humans impose upon them.</paragraph><paragraph>The <bold>defining characteristic</bold> of animals is ignorance, in the form of <bold>stupidity</bold> , in a life dominated by concern for food and reproduction. Although within their own realms of action, animals can show remarkable intelligence and skill, they cannot, in general, understand dharma and could not follow a path of spiritual evolution, as we humans can. As always, there are exceptions but these only serve to confirm the rule.</paragraph>Deprived Spirits or "Hungry Ghosts"<paragraph>Their Sanskrit name sounds like <italic>préta</italic> . These beings are generally invisible to humans, when they live in the same lands. Many are said to live in sand or ice deserts and lonely places. Their rebirth is a result of <bold>avarice,</bold> their <bold>defining characteristic</bold> , and their lives are like an avaricious person's worst nightmare: that of never getting what one most longs for or of losing it just as it seems to be assured. Some of these spirits are powerful ghosts or demons and, through the complexity of their karma, have considerable powers in certain areas, yet this gigantic, hollow, unsatisfied yearning in others. The <italic>préta</italic> "aristocrats" are the lieutenants of the Lord of Death and have abodes in cavernous spaces deep beneath the earth. The rest are pitiable, isolated creatures, sometimes living in tiny groups of families <a href="#_ftn32">[30]</a>.</paragraph><paragraph>The deprived spirits have three major types of suffering, mainly related to eating or drinking:</paragraph><paragraph>1. An external impediment, whereby they can never find something to eat or drink, not even a scrap, despite roaming and searching for months on end. Sometimes they do find something but often only to see it snatched from under their eyes or to find other beings barring them from eating it. Or else it turns to pus and blood in their perception. In our human world, we have those unfortunate people in places of famine and poverty whose lives are a wretched search for food. The humans often die quickly. The deprived spirits do not have the "escape route" of death but a seemingly-unending frustrating and desperate search for food or water lasting for centuries.</paragraph><paragraph>2. An internal impediment, whereby they have "bellies the size of a mountain but a mouth the size of a needle".</paragraph><paragraph>3. A general impediment, whereby when at last food or drink is found, its ingestion causes unimaginable pain, being like fire-garlands or molten copper or else tasting like filth.</paragraph><paragraph>These spirits live for around five hundred or their own years, which are said to be the equivalent of fifteen thousand of our years. Many of these spirits have clear recall of their previous lives, as humans, and of the avaricious acts which caused their sorry lot. We find accounts of them in the likes of the stories told by Million In The Ear <a href="#_ftn33">[31]</a>.</paragraph>3. Hell-Dwellers<paragraph>Their <bold>defining characteristic</bold> is <bold>anger</bold> . They fall into four main categories:</paragraph><list kind="ol"><item>Those in eight hot hells , undergoing all sorts of torture from heat and physical pain. The various degrees of agony are due to being crushed, or cut up, or being burnt by coals, molten metal etc., with no relief through "death" but mini-revivals, only to start the agony all over again.</item><item>Those in eight cold hells , undergoing severe cold and physical pain. These tend to be desolate, grim, arctic landscapes.</item><item>Those in the four "neighbouring" hells , each with its specific plight, such as swamps of filth or trees with razor-sharp leaves.</item><item>Those in occasional hells , which, unlike the above, produced by commonplace anger, violence and harm to others, are produced by very unusual karma in past lives. These could be almost anything, anywhere.</item></list><paragraph>These hells are mainly spoken of as being located kilometres beneath the earth. Their duration is complicated and very long indeed, comparable to the gods' life-spans. The details can be found in Gampopa, who concludes:</paragraph><paragraph>One may wonder whether or not the guardians of the hells—who appear to be humans or ravens with iron beaks—are actual sentient beings. The Particularist <a href="#_ftn34">[32]</a>schools hold them to be sentient beings whereas the Sutra Follower <a href="#_ftn35">[33]</a>schools say they are not. The Practisers of Union <a href="#_ftn36">[34]</a>schools and the patriarchal transmission of Marpa and Mila <bold>hold them to be manifestations of one's own mind</bold> , due to evils one has enacted. The Guide to the Bodhisattva Life accords with this interpretation:</paragraph><paragraph>Who could have created the beings there and their hellish weapons for such purposes? Who made the burning iron ground and from what are the fires generated. The Great Sage has said that all these sorts of things are due to the existence of an unwholesome mind.</paragraph><paragraph>Many people have a tough time or strong reaction when they discover that Buddhism, like some other faiths, has notions of hell, with description not dissimilar to those of Catholicism etc. As explained above, by Gampopa, these hells are not places but states of mind. Angry or evil people carry the imprints of their conditioning and past deeds in their consciousness. At death, this consciousness experiences hell, just as a dreamer has a nightmare in which the horrible circumstances seem completely real, all-encompassing and unending. Human dreamers are awoken by their physical body. Without a body, those who die and enter into these ghastly hallucinations have no biology to stop the repetitive nightmare. The realities experienced make a lot of sense: an angry person's dream is to blame and defeat the enemy and worst nightmare is to be beaten and humiliated themselves.</paragraph><paragraph>Anyone who has experienced the horrors of war zones or locked psychiatric wards will understand that if such things are possible for humans, worse is possible for a mind let loose by death to plunge into its worst phantasms.</paragraph></subsubsection></subsection></section><section index="7" title="The Five Aggregates (Skandha)" pagetitle="The Five Aggregates (Skandha)" tocentry="The Five Aggregates (Skandha)"><subsection title="The Five Aggregates (Skandha)" pagetitle="The Five Aggregates (Skandha)" tocentry="The Five Aggregates (Skandha)"><image width="461" src="module2_files.image012.png" align=""/><paragraph>As the First Truth is about beings and their worlds, we shall consider briefly the five <italic>skandha</italic> , as it is through them that a sentient being is defined.

The remaining ones are <italic>secondary forms</italic> .</paragraph><paragraph>2. The <bold>Five Sense Organs &amp; Faculties</bold>: giving the power to see, hear, smell, taste and touch.</paragraph><paragraph>3. Their <bold>Five Fields</bold>: sights, sounds, odours, flavours and tactile sensations.</paragraph><paragraph>4. <bold>Other forms</bold> , including abstract forms, such as maintaining precepts, "making a prostration", where the mind relates to a series of actions through its knowledge of the intention behind them etc. Also "unrecognisable forms", such as a meditation experience of colour, in one person's mind, imperceptible to another's.</paragraph><paragraph>2. <bold>Feelings.</bold> This term has a quite specific and limited meaning in dharma. It simply refers to the initial reaction to something as being:</paragraph><paragraph> <bold>1.</bold>  <bold>Pleasant.</bold> </paragraph><paragraph> <bold>2.</bold>  <bold>Unpleasant or</bold> </paragraph><paragraph> <bold>3.</bold>  <bold>Neutral.</bold> </paragraph><paragraph>Hence there are three feelings only. If we sub-categorise the first two into physical or mental, this gives a maximum of five feelings.</paragraph><paragraph>3. <bold>Cognition</bold> is the recognising of things: the "apprehension of characteristics". It is of two sorts:</paragraph><paragraph>1. <bold>Object-related</bold> , whereby grass can be distinguished from rock, a wolf's howl can be distinguished from the sound of wind etc. This is something directly and immediately perceived and <italic>does not require thought</italic> . Therefore animals and all other beings have this.</paragraph><paragraph>2. <bold>Idea-Related</bold> , where the thinking mind <italic>labels</italic> its object-related perceptions and even goes on to refine that recognition through elaborating thoughts and describing things to itself, in thought-words, at length. This is highly-developed in humans.</paragraph><paragraph>4. <bold>Mental Events</bold> , Mental Factors, also called Conditioning Factors. This category includes some of the other four aggregates, extracted and given their own categories because they play such an important role in the quality of life. There are 51 main headings in this section, including the 11 main virtues of mind, the 6 and 21 non-virtues and various mechanisms of the mind.</paragraph><paragraph>5. <bold>Consciousness</bold> . This word too has a very tightly-defined meaning in dharma. It is "that which links the perceiving mind with what is perceived". Thus we have five sense consciousnesses and mental consciousness:</paragraph><list kind="ol"><item> Visual Consciousness , linking the power to see with visible forms.</item><item> Hearing Consciousness , linking the power to hear with sounds.</item><item> Smelling or Olfactory  Consciousness , linking the power to smell with odours.</item><item> Tasting or Gustative  Consciousness , linking the power to taste with flavours.</item><item> Tactile Consciousness , linking the body's ability to feel with sensations, such as heat, cold, hunger, texture, pain etc.</item><item> Mental Consciousness , linking the perceiving mind with whatever it is thinking about or experiencing. The sphere of mind's objects is known as dharma .</item></list><paragraph>To these six, found throughout Buddhism, the Mind-Only school very usefully adds two more:</paragraph><list kind="ol"><item> Distorting Consciousness , which "warps" the experience of the six consciousnesses by adding duality. It also triggers the next moment of consciousness.</item><item> Universal Basis Consciousness , which is like the neutral ground, or storehouse of consciousness, retaining karmic and memory imprints.</item></list></subsection></section><footnotes><footnote id="1">The Sanskrit word dharma has ten different meanings. One commonly used set of definitions is obtained from Vasubhandu's "vy a khy a yukt i " where it gives them as 1) phenomena; 2) path; 3) "nirv an a; 4) "mental object"; 5) "merit"; 6) "life"; 7) "religious teaching"; 8) material objects, physical things made of the five elements; 9) a regulation which must be followed; 10) religion.

As we saw above, it is not a religion but neither is it simply a philosophy, as its whole aim is to transcend the intellect (the home of philosophy) and it is something to be practised rather than just to be thought about.</footnote><footnote id="4">Based upon talks given by HH the 14th Dalai Lama, the XIIth Kuangting Tai Situpa and Dharma-Arya Akong Rinpoche.</footnote><footnote id="5"> tripitaka</footnote><footnote id="6">21 main sub-defilements are mentioned in the abhidharma: wrath, resent, rage, irritation, jealousy, discontent, deceit, pretence, absence of dignity, absence of shame, dissimulation, avarice, narcissism, faithlessness, laziness, negligence, absence of mindfulness, absence of awareness, torpor, agitation and total distraction.</footnote><footnote id="7">The word tantra means «thread» or «continuum» and refers to the never-ceasing and inalterable presence of buddha nature in our mind, whether that mind be in heaven, on earth or in hell*, whether it be that of a beginner, that of someone on the path or a buddha's. The practices of tantr a aim to put one in touch with the buddha nature, by attuning to its many qualities using very specific practices taught by the sambhogakaya of the Buddha. These usually involve visualisation and mantras. For instance, one attunes to the healing power of the buddha mind by focussing on the totally-meaningful mind-image of the Medicine Buddha.</footnote><footnote id="8">The accounts vary: some say two weeks, some seven.</footnote><footnote id="9">Known more commonly under their names of earth, water, fire, wind and space elements (see Module 3).</footnote><footnote id="10">.
