            <subsubsection title="Defining what is not" pagetitle="Defining what is not"
                           tocentry="Defining what is not">
               <paragraph>You
may remember from Module One that _nirvana_ is not a term defining "something".
It is only telling us what is _no longer present_. It means "beyond
suffering", meaning that all the suffering of samsara (First Truth) and all of
its causes (Second Truth) have been removed.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>What
is there when samsara has finished? What is it like? There is no single answer
to this question, as different Buddhist schools and traditions have their own
understandings of "nirvana". Their differences can be significant yet
fairly easy to describe. They can also be, to translate Naropa's own words to
Marpa, "exceedingly, immensely profound".  In this module, we will mainly study
two things:</paragraph>
               <paragraph>(eh)·     
*Liberation* or _just nirvana_, the
Hinayana goal.(eeh)</paragraph>
               <paragraph>(eh)·     
*Enlightenment* or _non-abiding nirvana_,
the Mahayana goal.(eeh)</paragraph>
               <paragraph>The main point of this Third Truth is that
suffering _can_ be ended forever. </paragraph>
            </subsubsection>
            <subsubsection title="Results by removal" pagetitle="Results by removal"
                           tocentry="Results by removal">
               <paragraph>The
goal, _nirvana_, can only be attained as the consequence of a long,
intelligent, industrious process. It is a type of result is known as _result
through removal_. This is usually compared by our lamas to emptying a room.
The empty room results from removal (of the furniture etc.) but all the effort
of shifting the armchairs and tables does not actually "create" the emptiness (voidness)
itself. The space of the room was always there and remains unchanged. No one
can "create" space: one can only remove whatever was obstructing it. Perhaps another,
more vivid, example is that of drawing back thick curtains on a bright morning.
The sun was already shining outside and the room was already full of receptive space
and reflective surfaces yet the presence of the curtains made it a dark room.
By pulling back the curtains, the room becomes filled with bright sunlight.
However, the effort of moving the curtains does not create the light itself.
The sun does that.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>This
point is important. When you construct a house the end result is composed of
the materials that you have been handling for months--bricks, timber, paint and
the like? However, when we do all the dharma work of the "path", the end result
does not need at all to resemble the study, meditation, prostrations and so
forth we have been doing for years, because those things served primarily to
remove, not to construct. </paragraph>
               <paragraph>Dharma
is a destructive or deconstructive process. Some examples:</paragraph>
               <list kind="ul">
                  <li>By
     removing busyness and agitation, there is natural peace. </li>
                  <li>By
     removing endless desires, there is natural satisfaction. </li>
                  <li>By
     removing  self-centredness, there emerges a natural awareness of others
     and care for them.</li>
                  <li>By
     removing illusions, there is natural lucidity about things. </li>
                  <li>By
     removing fear of loss and stinginess, there is natural generosity.</li>
               </list>
               <paragraph>There
are endless such examples. Nirvana is the 100% destruction of all the _personal_
samsara forever and that includes the thorough elimination of samsara's causes.
The destruction of _everyone's_ samsara is another question.</paragraph>
            </subsubsection>
            <subsubsection title="Freedom - Cessation and Vimuktikaya"
                           pagetitle="Freedom - Cessation and Vimuktikaya"
                           tocentry="Freedom - Cessation and Vimuktikaya">
               <paragraph>The
focus of this Third Truth is on freedom. The entire notion of "freedom" only
makes sense in terms of the bondage from which someone has been freed or
remains free. To no longer carry the karma of suffering is a freedom. To no
longer have a mind pained by unfulfilled desires is a freedom. To be beyond
anger is a freedom. To no longer be reborn into suffering is the greatest
freedom. Those whose minds long for freedom should know that there is no
greater freedom than this.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>The
Hinayana view of nirvana is simply the ending of samsara: "like a candle
completely burned out". The term _cessation_ fits perfectly. The non-abiding
nirvana achieved in Mahayana Buddhism (see below) is not just the end of the
suffering but also the total awakening of the buddha mind. The buddha mind has
many facets or _kaya_ and this particular facet--of +absence of+
samsara and of samsara's causes--is called the _vimuktikaya_. _Vimukti_
means total liberation. The +presence of+ enlightened qualities is, in
this context, known as _dharmakaya_. Dharmakaya and vimuktikaya occur as a
pair, in the scriptures, to make clear what _is_ and what _is not_
part of enlightenment.  </paragraph>

                           tocentry=" Why teach this Truth?">
               <paragraph>Cessation
is an extremely profound topic. One of the main points about it is its
indescribability. The Buddha taught whatever can be said about it--and we learn
about it--because, by appreciating the point of this Third Truth (freedom from
samsara), we will be inspired to dedicate our lives to the path of practice,
which is the Fourth Truth. From reflection upon this Third Truth comes heartfelt
conviction that total freedom from samsara is possible and that the bonds imprisoning
the mind can be broken forever. It is harder to follow a path when one has no
idea where it is going.</paragraph>
            </subsubsection>
            <subsubsection title="A classical approach to the Third Truth"
                           pagetitle="A classical approach to the Third Truth"
                           tocentry="A classical approach to the Third Truth">
               <paragraph>As
with the previous two truths, it is presented through four aspects denoted by
four key terms: *cessation, peace, excellence* and *definite transcendence*.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>*_Cessation_* is defined as the end of
suffering and its causes (karma and afflictions). This is not a temporary end
but a definite end, as not only are those things removed but also any habitual
tendency related to them has been removed. Thus, there is no remaining cause
for them to reoccur. This point is the continued _absence_ of any of those
elements of samsara.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>*_Peaceis a term that is often
substituted for _nirvana_. Whereas the previous term points to what was
abandoned, this term points to the lasting happiness that is thereby achieved. _Peace
_does not mean a great sleep--the ultimate cosmic tranquilizer--but denotes a
clarity that cannot be troubled. In that sense, it is like the terms unruffled,
unperturbed or untroubled. This is in stark contrast to samsara, which is
naturally _disturbed_ and chaotic. Samsaric life demands constant effort
and attention. Things can go wrong at any moment, through the eruption of
emotions inside or karmic surprises outside.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>*_Excellence_* refers to the qualities
present in nirvana. This is the translation of the Sanskrit _praṉīta_ which means _the very best_.
There is no better than this, the purest, most liberated state possible for any
mind.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>*_Definite
transcendenceis a term
highlighting the transcendent nature of nirvana. Unlike the ups-and-downs of
samsara, where there can be ecstasy and seemingly wonderful times but which
then change into something else, this is transcendent forever.</paragraph>
            </subsubsection>
         </subsection>
         <subsection title="Nirvana and Enlightenment" pagetitle="Nirvana and Enlightenment"
                     tocentry="Nirvana and Enlightenment">
            <image width="461"/>
            <paragraph>As
mentioned above, the Hinayana and Mahayana differ in their understanding of
what is to be accomplished in the Third Truth. Both agree that the main point
is that three things--samsaric suffering, karma and the afflictions--are
eliminated definitively. Thereby, suffering and its causes are destroyed and "nirvana"
is attained. However, the Mahayanists consider that the incredibly long-lasting
peace attained through the Hinayana path of meditation and wisdom _is not the
ultimate peaceand nirvana_ that the Buddha himself attained and that,
ultimately, all his followers will attain. In order to achieve the Mahayana
nirvana--"non-abiding nirvana"--the dualistic split and dualistic thought (see
Module 3) need also to be totally eliminated. Only then can all the glorious,
natural qualities of enlightenment shine forth.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For Mahayanists, the Hinayana journey is seen as
primarily one of renouncing samsara and withdrawing into the profound peace of
concentration meditation--as
outlined through the Four Dhyana and the Four Formless Meditations in the
section on immobility karma in Module 3. This ever-deepening absorption in
meditation has its own strong magnetic power. What happens is that the
meditator finds more and more satisfaction as the mind furthers its refinement
and stability. There is a natural wish to take the process further and a
feeling of renunciation develops more and more pronouncedly, because samsara's
chaotic meaninglessness is witnessed from a place of deep, inner peace.
Although, with respect to other people, the meditator will naturally become a
kinder, more tranquil person through this process, the preoccupation with
withdrawal and renunciation does not encourage putting compassionate action to
the forefront. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)Concentration meditation is also
employed in the Mahayana path--mainly as a +support+ for the development of
wisdom, as insight into the mind. But the Mahayana is extremely wary of
meditation's inherent magnetic pull. Recognising that compassion is the main
quality needed for attaining a Buddha's enlightenment, Mahayanists precede,
underpin and finish all meditation with the good compassionate heart, keeping
the motivation fixed on all sentient beings' welfare rather than one's own
preoccupation with meditative prowess; with meditation's beauty, with peace for
ineself. The end result is to achieve a _non-abiding nirvana,_ so-called because:(eeh)</paragraph>
            <list kind="ul">
               <li>(eh)Great compassion prevents it from
     dwelling in the Hinayana peace.(eeh)</li>
               <li>(eh)Non-dual wisdom, rooted in
     meditation, prevents it dwelling in samsara.(eeh)</li>
            </list>
            <subsubsection title="Why did the Buddha not teach everyone Mahayana?"
                           pagetitle="Why did the Buddha not teach everyone Mahayana?"
                           tocentry="Why did the Buddha not teach everyone Mahayana?">
               <paragraph>(eh)Why did the Buddha teach the Hinayana
way? Why did he not teach everyone the path based on love and compassion and
non-dual wisdom? He simply could not, because such a path is not suited for
everyone and the very characteristic of the Buddha's teaching is to teach what
is best suited to a person's capacities and aspirations. The ambitious perspective
of Mahayana--that of helping all sentient beings--would be far too daunting for
many people. Many people need first to find solutions to their own confusion
and to taste the peaceful stability of meditation before they can even consider
thinking of helping others. (eeh)</paragraph>
               <paragraph>Gampopa
explains the Buddha's teaching of the Hinayana path through an analogy and then
goes on to describe what happens at the end of the Hinayana path, when the
arhats "migrate" to Mahayana:</paragraph>
               <paragraph>"What they achieve is not actually nirvana. At
the time of their achievement they will, on account of a condition of subtle, latent
ignorance, acquire and exist in a subtle mental body, brought about by their
[former] untainted karma. However, they themselves are convinced that the state
of untainted profound absorption they enjoy _is_ the nirvana and that they
_have attained_ nirvana: it is not real nirvana though and this may lead
some to question the propriety of the Buddha teaching those two paths (Hinayana
and Mahayana).</paragraph>
               <paragraph>    It was, in fact, extremely appropriate for
the Buddha to teach them as he did. Let us consider the following example. Some
merchants from Rose Apple Land<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
set out to the far-off oceans to obtain its precious gems. At one point in
their journey, while crossing a great wilderness, they felt so tired and
downhearted that they started thinking that they would never manage to get the
jewels and they contemplated turning back. However their leader created,
through his magical powers, a great illusory citadel where they were able to
rest and recuperate their strength. Once fortified, they set off in good
spirits and succeeded in their quest.  </paragraph>
               <paragraph>    Like the merchants in the example, beings
with little strength of resolution will be quite afraid when they learn about
the tremendous wisdom of the buddhas and may feel that the task of achieving it
is too daunting; far beyond the capacity of the likes of them. On account of
the awe they feel, they will either never undertake the task of enlightenment
or else they will [start out but] give up. By teaching the two paths of the
Shravaka and Pratyekabuddha, the Buddha enables them to attain the refreshing,
healing state of Shravaka or Pratyekabuddha. In the _Sublime Dharma White
Lotus Sutra_ it says:</paragraph>
               <paragraph>Likewise all the Shravaka are under the
impression that they have attained nirvana. The Buddha tells them this is not
nirvana but a respite.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>When they have rested and refreshed themselves
in the state of Shravaka or Pratyekabuddha, the Buddha knows it is time to
encourage them to achieve full enlightenment. How is this done?  The Buddha
inspires them through perfect body, pure speech and wisdom mind. Light rays
stream from his mind. By these beams merely touching their mental bodies, the
Shravaka and Pratyekabuddha are awakened from their untainted profound absorption.
Then the Buddha manifests his own perfect presence and says the following with
his pure speech:</paragraph>
               <paragraph>O monks. By merely doing what you have done,
the task is not being accomplished and the work is not yet done. Your nirvana
is not _the_ nirvana. Monks! Now approach the Tathagata and pay heed to
what he says; understand his instruction. </paragraph>
               <paragraph>Thus he motivates them. This is also taught in
the verses of the _Sublime Dharma White Lotus Sutra_: </paragraph>
               <paragraph>O monks! I therefore tell you today that by
merely this you will not attain nirvana and that for you to gain the pristine
cognition of the omniscient ones you must give rise to a noble and mighty wave
of effort. By so doing, you will achieve all-knowing pristine cognition.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>Through being exhorted in this way, the Shravaka
and Pratyekabuddha will cultivate the great bodhicitta. Having conducted
themselves as bodhisattvas for countless ages, they will become buddhas. We
find this stated in the _Sublime Dharma White Lotus Sutra_ in the same way
as it is stated in the _Going to Lanka Sutra_:</paragraph>
               <paragraph>Those Shravaka who have not attained nirvana
will all, through having practiced the bodhisattva way of life, become buddhas."</paragraph>

            <paragraph>*_Four
Stages of Attainment_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)There are four major stages of attainment
in the Hinayana journey to total freedom from samsara:(eeh)</paragraph>
            <list kind="ol">
               <li>(eh)Stream-entrant.(eeh)</li>
               <li>(eh)One-time returner.(eeh)</li>
               <li>(eh)Non-returner.(eeh)</li>
               <li>(eh)Arhat.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>(eeh)</li>
            </list>
            <paragraph>*_Stream
Entrant_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The
stream entered is that of the Noble Eightfold Path. The stream-entrant is one
who:</paragraph>
            <list kind="ol">
               <li>Has
     overcome the power of illusions of self.</li>
               <li>Has
     overcome sceptical doubt, in particular about karma and reincarnation.</li>
               <li>Has
     given up attachment to rituals, especially those based in an idea that
     spirituality is accomplished by austerities and asceticism.</li>
               <li>Has
     opened the eye of dharma, meaning that there is much intuitive
     understanding of dharma through mastery of study and meditation.</li>
               <li>Has
     virtuous conduct.</li>
               <li>Has
     confidence in the Three Precious Refuges.</li>
            </list>
            <paragraph>In
brief, like someone who has fallen into the current of a strong river, this
person will be swept forward by dharma, which has become so strongly implanted
that nothing can reverse it. Such a person is seen as attaining liberation in,
at most, seven lifetimes. The stream-entrant can no longer be reborn in the
lower realms.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*_One-time
Returner_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Following
on from the above, the disciple will reach a point where the next incarnation
in samsara will be the last one: the one in which liberation (arhat state) is
attained. At this stage there is freedom from:</paragraph>
            <list kind="ol">
               <li>Belief
     in self.</li>
               <li>Sceptical
     doubt.</li>
               <li>Attachment
     to austerities and ritual.</li>

     gross aspects of) sensual craving.</li>
               <li>(The
     gross aspects of) ill-will.</li>
            </list>
            <paragraph>*_Non-Returner_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This
is someone actually in the last reincarnation in the sensorial dimension of
samsara. After death, it is possible for such a person to be reborn in the pure
deva realms (see Module 2), where meditation practice will be brought to
completion. At this stage there are five freedoms:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>1.    
From
belief in self.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>2.    
From
sceptical doubt.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>3.    
From
attachment to austerities and rituals.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>4.    
From
sensual craving.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>5.    
From
ill-will.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Yet
there are still traces of the following five blockages:</paragraph>
            <list kind="ol">
               <li>Fine
     craving for material existence (meaning the meditative absorptions of the
     Four Dhyana {see Module 2}).</li>
               <li>Fine
     craving for immaterial existence (the Four Formless Absorptions).</li>
               <li>Pride.</li>
               <li>Restlessness.</li>
               <li>Ignorance.</li>
            </list>
            <paragraph>*_Arhat
- one who has achieved nirvana_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Also
found as _arhant_ or _arahant_. The word means _noble one_
implying _one who has laid down the burden_. The Tibetan translation means
_one who has defeated the enemy_, the enemy being suffering and its
causes. This is someone who has attained total liberation, being forever free
from all the ten blockages mentioned above.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Mipham
Rinpoche, in his teachings on abhidharma, defines four types of arhat:</paragraph>
            <list kind="ol">
               <li>_Arhat
     with remainders_
     applies during the period of time between attaining the arhat state and
     death. If we take the Hinayana understanding of the Buddha's own life, as
     an example, it applies to the forty-five years between his "enlightenment"
     (which for them means becoming an arhat) and his passing into total
     nirvana. An arhat with remainders is therefore someone who has
     extinguished all causes of suffering yet still has some suffering-as-results
     to live through and it is these karmic results that keep them alive. Once
     the karma has run out, they die: samsara is over. </li>
               <li>_Arhat
     without remainders_
     is one in whom all suffering and causes of suffering have been
     extinguished. This is attained when the arhat with remainders dies. </li>
               <li>_Unadorned
     arhats_
     are those who have solely achieved freedom.</li>
               <li>_Adorned
     arhats_
     have achieved freedom but also have many special qualities and
     accomplishments, due to long practice of many different forms of
     meditation.</li>

Karmapa, please visit <a href="http://www.khenpo.eu/17k16arhat.jpg">here</a>
(many thanks to Karma Triyana for permission to use).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Many
people achieved the state of arhat in the early days of Buddhism. In the first
council we hear of a gathering of five hundred<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
arhats and there are many mentions of them in large number. As the centuries
passed, the numbers dwindled and none are spoken of in recent times. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>In
Chinese Buddhism, sixteen famous arhats are particularly venerated. In a spirit
similar to that of the bodhisattvas, these sixteen decided not to pass into
nirvana but to remain to help beings, taking up residence in the various
continents of our world as it appeared to be to people in India and China two
millennia ago.  Their names and abodes are given in <a href="#Arhat16">Annexe 1</a>.

            <paragraph>*1.         What is removed
or avoided to attain it*</paragraph>
            <image width="261"/>
            <paragraph>Progress
on the path equates to obstacles being removed. Those obstacles are karma, the
afflictions and duality. Their removal, in whole or in part, allows the natural
qualities that they have been blocking to appear. In Year Two, we will enter
into the detail of the five major stages of the Buddhist path. Each stage, and
indeed many a sub-stage, has its own particular area of things to be worked on
and eliminated. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Throughout
this dharma journey, two major motor forces are employed to bring this about:
wisdom and compassion. These can also be called _wisdom and skilful means_.
</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Wisdom* means a deep realisation of
voidness. It develops through first study, then intelligent reflection and
finally meditation on such things as:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>·     
The
impermanent nature of everything (absence of lasting entity).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>·     
The
absence of own entity, because of interdependence.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>·     
The
dream-like nature of all things (absence of objective reality).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>·     
The fact
that involvement with illusions of _permanence_ and _self_ cause
suffering. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Throughout the
path, it is such understanding which keeps one away from *samsara*. The wisdom, established by
thorough investigation, becomes more complete and more profound as the path
progresses and becomes 100% perfect with buddhahood. In particular, this wisdom
comes to focus on the non-dual, void nature of each moment of relative
perception and on the ultimate buddha nature which permeates all.   </paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)    As mentioned just now,
there are three steps to wisdom: study, reflection and meditation:(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)1.     _Study_ means the proper
acquisition of information. This usually happens through formal oral teachings,
the study of texts and discussion with the sangha. This involves mastering the
specialised and precise terminology of dharma, which in turn makes it possible
to reason clearly and intelligently.(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)2.     _Reflection_ means a deep consideration
of the meaning of what has been studied. In particular, it involves comparing one's
own habitual feelings and ideas with what has been learnt. Any conflict or area
of doubt needs to be resolved. The personal counsel of dharma masters is often
the means for doing this.(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)3.     _Meditation_ does not mean simply
sitting meditation, although that is part of the process. The actual term
actually means _familiarisation_. This is well-expressed by the English
expression _becoming second nature_ (the words of which make little sense
when translated back into Tibetan!). When the truths of dharma no longer need
to be thought about but are vivid realities, shining second after second, this
third stage has been achieved.(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)*Compassion*
or *Skilful Means* is an immense topic. It could be described as _accumulation
and purification_. It is best explained in detail through the first five of
the six _paramita_,
which will be developed at length in Year Two of this course. Compassion, which
starts out as an attitude, becomes an entire way of life--a way of being--as a
certain softness, warmth, generosity, selflessness, tolerance and
broad-mindedness mature in the person. It becomes an inimitable strength of
goodness and virtue. This goes hand-in-hand with the dwindling of painful karma
and the increase of positive karma.  The whole shines like light and serves
also as an important basis for wisdom. Mahayana wisdom is not cold, dry,
intellectual wisdom but, because it is "moistened" by compassion, the warm
wisdom of the famous "good heart". The
spontaneous and +selfless+ care for all beings that emerges from all this will
automatically counter the +self-centred+ magnetic pull of concentration
meditation, and this prevents one from undertaking the journey to the "*mere
nirvana*" of the Hinayana.(eeh)</paragraph>

            <paragraph>*_Nature_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The
nature of enlightenment is "*purity*" and this is explained, in the
commentaries, as meaning *lucid clarity<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>*--a
term which signifies both wisdom and purity. The wisdom (lucidity) of the
buddha mind is compared to the brilliant shining of the Sun and its purity
(clarity) to the vastness of the unobstructed space in which the Sun shines. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>*_Cause_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Enlightenment,
a result by removal, is something *achieved* principally by bring wisdom
to its fullness. Above, we saw that the three major steps of wisdom are _study,
reflection _and _meditation_. A Buddha's wisdom is hard for us to
imagine and it is helpful to understand it as being the final end of a long
journey of cultivating the third of these steps--meditation. From the outset, it
has two key aspects:</paragraph>
            <list kind="ol">
               <li>The
     first is cultivated during the most profound moments of meditation and is
     an unveiling of the formless, non-conceptual, void nature of mind itself.
     This is called *_non-conceptual wisdom._*</li>
               <li>The
     second aspect, cultivated in the post-meditation phase, is an intelligent
     understanding of the millions of things (_dharma_) of life. It is
     calledanalytical wisdom._*</li>
            </list>
            <paragraph>*_Fruition_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>As
a result, enlightenment is a freedom:</paragraph>
            <list kind="ol">
               <li>Simply
     by dwelling in the sheer transcendence of *non-conceptual wisdom*,
     desire and the other afflictions will fade away.</li>
               <li>*Analytical
     wisdom *knows
     each thing through each its specific details but, most importantly, also
     knows it to be not other than that very mind which recognises its own
     voidness in deep meditation. Mind, in post-meditation, is experiencing its
     karmic "movie", which seems "other" but is not other, just as a foreign
     land in a dream seems like a place being visited but is none other than
     the mind of the dreamer. Analytical wisdom helps overcome duality.</li>
            </list>
            <paragraph>When
these two wisdoms are totally perfected, the fruition achieved is
enlightenment.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*_Function_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The
function of enlightenment is to accomplish what is known as the *twofold
benefit*:</paragraph>
            <list kind="ol">
               <li>*Benefit
     for oneself*
     as the highest freedom and realisation.</li>
               <li>*Benefit
     for others*
     through enlightened activity.</li>
            </list>
            <paragraph>*_Endowments_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Enlightenment
is endowed with endless qualities, of which fifteen are particularly
highlighted. The first of these, and the most important, is it *inconceivability*.
Enlightenment cannot be imagined and cannot be made real by thought. When it
happens, it knows itself. Nothing else can _know_ it.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*_Actualisation_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Technically,
it is under this heading that we find enlightenment as the *three kayas*.
These have already been presented in general in Module One and will be
developed through eight qualities each in Module Eighteen. We can relate this
back to the twofold benefit, mentioned above. The dharmakaya is ultimate
benefit for oneself and the two form kayas (sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya) are
supreme benefit for others. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>*_Permanence_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Enlightenment,
as the three kayas, is permanent in three different ways:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>1.    
The
dharmakaya is naturally permanent, without beginning or end.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>2.    
The
sambhogakaya is permanent by its unceasing manifestation of pure lands to
deeply-realised bodhisattvas.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>3.    
The
nirmanakaya is permanent by always having some manifestation somewhere, even
though each of these manifestations is relatively short-lasting (for instance
the eighty years of Sakyamuni Buddha's life on earth.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*_Inconceivability_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This
topic comes back again and again as we explore the various facets of enlightenment.
It was mentioned above, as one of the fifteen endowments of enlightenment. Here
it is highlighted as being the eighth and final main quality of enlightenment.</paragraph>

            <image width="218"/>
            <paragraph>These
two important points will be developed more fully in Module Eighteen. Here
they, will be mentioned in brief. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>*_Enlightened
qualities_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)They are often summed up as the*
sixty-four qualities of enlightenment:*(eeh)</paragraph>
            <list kind="ul">
               <li>(eh)The *4 Fearlessnesses*.(eeh)</li>
               <li>(eh)The *10 Powers of Perfect
     Knowledge*.(eeh)</li>
               <li>(eh)The *18 Distinctive Qualities*
     of a Buddha.(eeh)</li>
               <li>(eh)The *32 extraordinary marks*
     of a Buddha.(eeh)</li>
            </list>
            <paragraph>To
these we can add the 80 minor signs, 60 qualities of speech and so forth, some
of which are in the annexes to Module One.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>**</paragraph>
            <paragraph>**</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*_Enlightened
activity_*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The
actual forms that this activity takes are infinite, breath-taking in their
variety and filled with grace, power and splendour. Enlightened activity is the
response of the omniscient wisdom, total compassion and skill of ultimate
reality to the confusion and suffering of beings in the world.  </paragraph>
            <paragraph>The
texts concentrate, therefore, not so much on the myriad forms of compassionate
emanation but on the nature of enlightened activity itself. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)*Enlightened activity* is distinguished by two
qualities: (eeh)</paragraph>
            <list kind="ol">
               <li>(eh)Its *spontaneity*.(eeh)</li>
               <li>(eh)The fact that *it does not
     conceptualise*.(eeh)</li>
            </list>
            <paragraph>*The
spontaneity*
of enlightened activity is an innate quality, like that of a mirror to reflect.
Just as a mirror does not need to make any effort to reflect a person in front
of it yet nevertheless sends back a perfect image, so does the buddha mind not
have to make any effort to send the perfect response to a person's needs. Other
examples are those of the rain falling from monsoon clouds or the Sun shining
or the earth supporting plants, animals and humans. In all these cases, the
beneficial object just simply is what it is, and does what it does, without any
effort at all.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The
*non-thinking* quality of the buddha mind is an extension of the above.
The Sun does not need to think about each plant it will ripen, nor does a
mirror need to plan how to reflect this or that object. This point of
non-conceptualising is highlighted because, in the normal way of things,
successful actions require planning and clever thought. Often our activity goes
wrong because we did not think well enough about what we were doing. The
activity of a buddha mind bares no similarity to the activity of an ordinary
mind.  </paragraph>

            <paragraph>As
with the previous three Truths, this is presented through four key points: *path,
intelligent awareness, accomplishment* and *definite emergence*.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Path* is a word defining this Fourth
Truth as a journey. It is a long and progressive journey leading eventually to
the cessation of suffering, explained in the Third Truth. The path consists of
blending ethical conduct, meditation and wisdom development into a personal
transformation known famously as _following the path of peace_.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Intelligent
awareness* (Sanskrit
_vidya,_ Tibetan _rig pa_). In this context<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a>,
this is wise awareness focused on the true nature of reality. Its opposite, _avidya_,
is the ignorance which lies at the very root of samsara (as we saw in the Second
Truth, Interdepen-dence). The Buddhist path opens up clear awareness--"clarity"--concerning
ultimate reality. It is centred on developing this clarity, as this
automatically dispels ego delusions and, by consequence, the whole samsaric
process.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Accomplishment* refers to the diligent work
of actually treading the path; making it a reality. This achievement is based
on modelling oneself devotedly on the example set by the Buddha.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Definite
emergence*
or renunciation is the real turning away, step by step, from samsara. This is
directly related to the fourth point of the Third Truth--definite
transcendence--and is, in fact, its cause. Definite transcendence is the end
result of this progressive turning away from the afflictions and harmful karma.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>One
of the earliest ways of analysing the journey to liberation was through the "five
phases of the path". These portray the necessary and inevitable transformations
that the mind must go through in order to get rid of its karma and harmful
habits, as well as to acquire deep meditative experience and penetrative
wisdom.  With the advent of Mahayana Buddhism, this same, essential, fivefold
model was maintained, with its detailed explanation being adapted to suit the
actual Mahayana journey.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>   
Each phase requires the development of particular qualities. Taken together,
they are known as the *thirty-seven factors of awakening*. Below is a
simple table, going up from the beginnings, represented by our ordinary

            <paragraph>*The Phase of Accumulation*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This
covers an immense area, from a beginner's first steps in dharma through to profound
stability in meditation and considerable purity of being. Many a famous saint
or reincarnate lama would still have been technically in this stage. It can be
summed up as three major steps:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>·     
Getting
to understand oneself and the world.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>·     
Changing
one's life radically in the light of that knowledge.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>·     
Thoroughly
refining the mind.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This
makes a lot of sense. Just as someone cannot repair a car engine without first
understanding how it works and then what has gone wrong, so likewise a life cannot
seriously be transformed without first having clear knowledge of its mechanisms,
its positive points and its errors. Then, once it is working well, one can
fine-tune its qualities. These three steps, which correspond to the three
stages of the phase of accumulation, are classically presented as:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*The Four Foundations of
Mindfulness*,
which bring vivid and direct awareness of: </paragraph>
            <paragraph>1.    
Physical
reality.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>2.    
Feelings.
</paragraph>
            <paragraph>3.    
Mind.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>4.    
Phenomena.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*The Four Eliminations* or four transformations:  </paragraph>
            <paragraph>5.    
Eliminating
what is harmful in one's life.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>6.    
Making
sure not to introduce any new harmful thing.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>7.    
Increasing
what is helpful in one's life.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>8.    
Introducing
new helpful skills.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*The Four Feet of Miracles<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>*:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>9.     Profound absorption
through unbroken longing.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>10.  Profound absorption
through unbroken diligence.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>11.  Profound absorption
through unbroken intention.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>12.  Profound absorption
through unbroken analysis.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The
above form the first twelve of the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In
actual reality, someone first turning up at a dharma centre will not
automatically be given the *Four Foundations of
Mindfulness as a first practice. Some people learn simple
concentration meditations, others learn vajrayana practices such as Chenrezik
and so on and so forth. "Be mindful" is a common counsel and any of
those practices can become the basis for developing mindfulness and
self-knowledge. What we are considering, in these five phases of the path and
thirty-seven factors, is a simplified, idealised journey. In it, the importance
of mindfulness can never be underestimated.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*The Four Eliminations*, as you probably noticed, are in fact
two areas of eliminating and two areas of nurturing. Together, they eliminate
suffering. This phase is an enormous work, only completed when the person is
truly, totally transformed. We could sum up these four eliminations by the two
well-known ideas of *purification *and* accumulation.*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*The Four Feet of Miracles* are a long work of meditation. This
stage has to be long since layer after layer of affliction has to be removed.
For instance, once strong passionate thoughts or angry thoughts have been
overcome by persistent meditation practice, one discovers more subtle thoughts
of passion and anger that were previously invisible. As these in turn are
evaporated by meditation, yet another, even more subtle layer is revealed. Nine
layers are mentioned<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a>
altogether.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*The Phase of Junction*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Most
of the above work deals with a transformation of one's habitual existence, i.e.
*relative reality*. The idea is to transform everything in one's life into
something positive and helpful. The phase of junction complements this with an
awakening to *ultimate reality*. It is called _junction_, or _yoga_
or _integration_, because one is learning how to join the mind with what
is ultimately true--voidness. This awakening is an intellectual one throughout
this phase--not a direct awareness, which comes in the next phase--yet it is
nevertheless very far-reaching. It happens in four steps:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Warming*,
as one warms to voidness. The analogy here is one of approaching a large fire
(fire of voidness which burns up illusions). Just as at one point, when
approaching the fire, its heat will be first sensed, so this stage is the one
in which the significance of voidness becomes appreciated.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Summit*,
or peak. The analogy here is one of a classical, conical mountain. The higher
one goes, the less earth there is and the more space. At the top, there is a
minimum of rock, a maximum of space and a panoramic view. At this stage the
mind is going from one understanding of voidness to the next, moment after
moment, with little hindrance.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Forbearance*
refers to an ability to forbear the reality-shattering implications of
voidness, in the light of which age-old delusions crumble away.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Highest Worldly Thing* is, as its name implies, the pinnacle
of worldly existence: the last step in the journey to liberation from samsara.
After this, there will be no more rebirth because of past karma. Samsara,
although beginningless, has an end: this is it.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>These
four stages of the Phase of Junction are accomplished through ten more factors
of enlightenment. These are in fact two sets of the same five things. During
the stages of *warming* and *summit* they are called *"five
faculties"* and during the stages of *forbearance* and *highest
worldly thing* they are called *"five powers"*, because they have now
become great strengths, due to skill in understanding voidness, applying it to
one's life and facing its implications.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>*The Phase of Insight*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This
is the great breakthrough--an irreversible direct insight into the nature of
truth. In the Hinayana, this means insight into the Four Noble Truths, with
four stages to be accomplished for each truth<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>,
making sixteen sub-stages in all. In the Mahayana, the breakthrough into the
heart-meaning of the Four Truths is accomplished in a single stroke by direct
realisation of voidness.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Seven Aspects of Awakening** (bodhi)* are the seven factors of enlightenment
operative during this phase:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right mindfulness. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right discerning
appreciation.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right diligence.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right joy.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right proficiency.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right profound
absorption.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right equanimity.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>You
may notice that many of these factors have already been mentioned in previous
phases. It is not that they are totally different here, but they are the
qualities that have special relevance at this point and that combined form the
tools needed to progress through this phase. Their nature is more subtle than
before.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Phase of Cultivation*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This
is also called the Phase of Meditation. Although insight has now been acquired,
forever, the life-stream of the person is still not yet fully-liberated. In the
light of the insight now gained, a long-term and increasingly-fine work of
meditation has to be accomplished, until the finest of finest impurities/blockages
have been radically removed. The factors of enlightenment required during this
time are those of the famous *eightfold path of
the noble ones:*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right view.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right concept.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right expression.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right limits of
action. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right livelihood. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right effort.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right mindfulness.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Right profound
absorption. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>At
this level *right view* is of primordial importance. The other seven
facets of the eightfold path all depend upon the view, which arises
spontaneously from a direct awareness of voidness. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Phase Beyond Training*</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This
is the end of the journey. For the Hinayanist, it is to become an arhat, and
they consider that such a state is eternal. For the Mahayanist, it means
becoming a Buddha. Since there is nothing left to be purified and nothing still
to be attained, there is no training, no "practice" and hence no related factor
of enlightenment. </paragraph>

                     tocentry="Three Main Components of the Path">
            <paragraph>(eh)The Buddhist "path", described above,
involves work in three areas:(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)*Right
conduct*.(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)*Meditation*.(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)*Wisdom *development.(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)Of these, the first concerns
interaction with other sentient beings and the world at large. It principally involves
actions (karma) of body and speech. The last two concern one's own 'mind karma'
and inner experience. There is no aspect of Buddhism that is not included in
the transformation of body, speech and mind and there is no Buddhist practice
that falls outside these three key areas of development.(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Right
conduct* is
traditionally based on vows or precepts, as these greatly reinforce the power
of physical and verbal actions. In general it is based on avoiding the ten
non-virtues and on cultivating the ten virtues. We will explore it in full in
our studies of the _paramita of right conduct_ next year. For the present,
we should be aware of its two main areas:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>1)   
Reducing
and eliminating any harm done to others.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>2)   
Increasing
virtuous, positive qualities in oneself.
To which the Mahayana adds</paragraph>
            <paragraph>3)   
Acquiring
skill in helping others.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Meditation* is a direct working with
the mind in order to overcome its harmful habits. This is primarily
accomplished through concentration. As the meditator learns to maintain the mind
focused on its object of meditation:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>·     
The
habitual power of thoughts and feelings to distract and occupy the mind is
reduced.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>·     
Peace
and absorption are attained.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>·     
Much
self-knowledge is acquired in the process.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Meditation
has the power to overcome the afflictions. Desires, anger, confusion, pride and
jealousy will be naturally reduced by its regular practice. Ego thoughts will,
to a certain extent, be laid bare and seen for the shallow illusions they are. _However_,
the finest wisdom--especially pure insight into the Four Truths--will not
necessarily emerge automatically. It may never emerge or take a long time, if
unaided by the wisdom development mentioned next.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>*Wisdom
development*
involves cultivating the three steps of wisdom: study, reflection and
meditation. It is primarily focused on the Four Truths. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Just
as concentration meditation will lead to peace but will not automatically give
rise to wisdom, similarly wisdom development does not necessarily bring inner
peace and stability nor does it reduce the afflictions. Wisdom and meditation
complement each other and they are both made strong, healthy and meaningful by
the strength of good karma obtained through a wholesome life of right conduct.   </paragraph>
            <paragraph>The
abhidharma texts point out how dharma people are different. According to their
past karma, some take easily to meditation and can develop great calm yet take
a long time to awaken to wisdom's clarity. Others have natural access to much
wisdom and insight yet are nervy and agitated, finding it hard to cultivate
their meditation practice. The texts explain to Buddhist teachers how to help
each one along the way, so that they acquire the skills they lack and use the
ones they already possess to good advantage.</paragraph>

         <subsection title="Refuge &amp; Precepts" pagetitle="Refuge &amp; Precepts"
                     tocentry="Refuge &amp; Precepts">
            <image width="162"/>
            <paragraph>The
way in which a person technically becomes a Buddhist is by formally
"taking refuge" in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. This outer,
ceremonial gesture is a reflection of the real refuge that forms the basis for
all Buddhist practice, namely placing one's trust in the that which is worthy
of trust and that can truly deliver the results. This extremely important topic
will be treated in Module Five, once we have studied a little about the sangha
and thereby completed this brief introduction to the Three Most Precious
Refuges (Buddha, dharma and sangha - the _triratna_ widely known as the
Three Jewels).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Furthermore,
the whole basis for right conduct is to take some degree of moral commitment
not to harm other beings (and oneself). There are many levels of such commitment,
suited to different lifestyles. They are known as "self-liberation
vows" (Skt: _pratimoksha_), since the free the mind from the shackles
of what is harmful. These too will be treated in Module Five.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Refuge
and precepts are universal in Buddhism, forming the working basis for Hinayana
and Mahayana and Vajrayana forms of practice. </paragraph>
         </subsection>
         <subsection title="The Mahayana Path" pagetitle="The Mahayana Path"
                     tocentry="The Mahayana Path">
            <image width="461"/>
            <paragraph>Two
thing absolutely dominate the Mahayana path: *compassion* and *deepest
wisdom* (voidness). The path starts with compassion, is in itself the development
of compassion and it ends as the total fullness of compassion. The basic
mechanisms described in the five phases of the path above still apply in
Mahayana. However, in Mahayana, that essential transformation of the human mind
occurs within a context of total compassion and deeper wisdom and that changes
everything. The results that emerge are different from those of the Hinayana
path. </paragraph>

diagram above shows the five paths in the Mahayana context. It is characterised
by the unique and all-important breakthrough of the Phase of Insight, described
by bodhisattvas as the finest moment in their entire existence. Before that
(area on green background), one is a "worldly being", going from one life to
the next, in samsara, through the force of karma. Worldly beings are called
"the immature" or "children" or "ordinary beings" or "individuals" in the
texts. The terms can be deceptive, as many a great lama and some of the kindest
people in this world still belong in that category.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>            At
the Phase of Insight, lasting, direct insight--known as _realisation_--into
the void nature of all things is not only gained but remains thereafter.
Samsara is finished, as is rebirth through karma. One can understand why the
Phase of Insight, which is also the 1st bodhisattva level, is called _Supreme
Joy_.  </paragraph>
            <paragraph>            After
insight, one traverses the ten bodhisattva levels (pink background) until all is perfect and one has become a
buddha (yellow background). The ten
levels--technically known as the _mahabodhisattva levels_--are also a
defining characteristic of the Mahayana path. The qualities and powers of the
beings of light who dwell on those levels are greater than those of the arhat.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The
final defining characteristic is that of the end result. As we saw above, in
the Truth of Cessation, the "freedom from samsara" of an arhat and of a buddha
is virtually the same. However, the very nature of a buddha's wisdom and
purity, as well as the qualities and activity of a buddha, far exceed those of
an arhat.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)Thus there are three distinct *phases
of being*:(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)1)    An "ordinary" being, or
"immature" being, living in the six realms.(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)2)    A great bodhisattva,
experiencing "pure lands".(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)3)    A buddha.(eeh)</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Just
as taking Refuge is the way in which one becomes Buddhist, taking the
bodhisattva vow is the way in which one enters the Mahayana stream of Buddhism.
As with Refuge, this is not merely a symbolic formality. The "vow" represents a
heartfelt commitment and it is the influence of that commitment on the mind--or
one could say its presence in the heart--that makes on a Mahayanist, or
bodhisattva.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)The* bodhisattva commitment* has
two distinct parts:(eeh)</paragraph>

            </list>
            <paragraph>(eh)The first, *bodhisattva aspiration*,
is often expressed as the profound wish to attain enlightenment, in order to be
of benefit to all beings and bring them to enlightenment too. The implicit
commitment is to nurture as purely as possible this wish, and its accompanying
ethics, as the basic mental component of bodhicitta. The aspiration serves as a
basis for the second--deeper-- pledge, which is to commit this and future lives
to the actual *bodhisattva practice*, resumed as the six _paramita_
or perfections.(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>These
two vows are taken through ceremonies. In the Tibetan tradition, one would
often wait until it were possible to take one or another of these vows from a
very famous master--a great living bodhisattva. These vows and their ceremonies
will be explored in depth in the coming modules and many modules will be
devoted to advice about keeping bodhisattva motivation and practice alive and
improving them.</paragraph>

               <paragraph>Although
the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment outlined above can all be found in
the bodhisattva's practice, they are no longer the main way of cataloguing it
or of understanding it. One simple way of approaching the Mahayana path, or
bodhisattva path, is through three steps:</paragraph>
               <paragraph>1.     Putting the necessary
components in place.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>2.     Making sure they do not
degrade.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>3.     Learning to strengthen,
deepen and expand them.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>These
three topics are the core of a famous prayer that we often use as a dedication.
It is, in fact, the summary of Santideva's "Guide to the Bodhisattva
Life", perhaps the most famous work on being a bodhisattva:</paragraph>
               <paragraph>_Supreme bodhicitta, so precious: may it
arise in those in whom it has not yet arisen (1)
. Once arisen, may it never deteriorate (2) but
become ever more magnificent (3)._</paragraph>
               <paragraph>The
main way in which we will study bodhisattva practice is through the combined
cultivation of _aspiration_ and _practice_. These two have to be inseparable because the state of mind of a
person at any given moment will determine whether the actions they are
performing are bodhisattva actions or not. When the aspiration--inspiration,
motivation, guiding light--is not present, the action is not bodhisattva action.
It may look good and may have all the outer form of generosity, pure conduct,
meditation or whatever. But it is no longer _bodhisattva generosity_ and _bodhisattva
conduct_ and therefore the results it generates do not contribute directly
to enlightenment. </paragraph>
               <paragraph>    Thus, the motivating bodhisattva mind--known as _bodhicitta_--is
all-important. It
is a huge and vital task to radically change the mind until it reacts to
circumstances naturally as a bodhisattva would.         However, there is more.
If a wonderfully loving mind, dedicated to enlightenment, never concretises
into real action and if someone's life does not become devoted in very
practical terms to the service of others ... then something is wrong, something
is sorely missing. </paragraph>
               <image width="162"/>
               <paragraph>Most
of Year Two of this course are dedicated to bodhisattva motivation and
practice, in detail, so we will leave the topic here for now, having touched on
it briefly in the context of the Fourth Truth, the Truth of the Path. </paragraph>
               <paragraph>There
is one vitally important aspect of all Buddhist practice--Hinayana or
Mahayana--that we will consider next: mindfulness. It is so important that it
could deserve a whole module to itself. On another hand, it is the practice of
it, in both meditation and daily life, not talking about it, which is the vital
thing. </paragraph>

               tocentry="Mindfulness, awareness and care">
         <image width="306"/>
         <paragraph>Mindfulness
belongs to a set of three absolutely crucial points: mindfulness, awareness and
care. These days, "mindfulness" courses, based on Buddhist method,
are very popular--not just for Buddhists--and they are bringing a benefit to many
people all over the world. The value of mindfulness is being clinically proven
in many trials. You'll perhaps see from the classical definitions below that
they should rather be called "awareness" courses, in Buddhist terms.
Also, "be mindful" is such frequent advice in dharma that it is good
to have a clear idea of *the
Buddhist implication of "mindfulness", which is not simply one of
being awake and aware, relaxed and in the present, but one of both remembering
and fulfilling sacred purpose*.</paragraph>
         <paragraph>In
the Mahayana, these three complementary factors correspond to the Four
Foundations of Mindfulness (the first four of the Thirty-Seven Factors of
Enlightenment). Here is a simple definition of each of the three, before we
consider the details:   </paragraph>
         <list kind="ul">
            <li>(eh)*Mindfulness* or _recollection_
     is very much to do with memory. A modern way to put it may be, "Don't
     lose the plot". In everyday life or in a session of meditation, one
     should not forget sacred purpose. In all Buddhism, it means remembering
     impermanence, suffering, no-self and voidness. In Mahayana, it means
     remembering the bodhisattva teachings and applying them more and more to
     each situation until they become second nature. It means recalling one's
     own teacher's personal instructions about how to act or react. It also
     means recalling the particular objective: for instance, in meditation it
     means remembering to stay with the particular focus of that practice.(eeh)</li>
            <li>(eh)*Awareness* is the natural
     companion of mindfulness. It is the "eye in the sky" that
     maintains awareness of body, speech and mind. Like a CCTV camera, it
     observes whether the purpose, the sacred intention, is actually being
     fulfilled or else being betrayed by what one is doing. This self-awareness
     needs to be very compassionate and wise. There is no point becoming a bag
     of nerves, constantly self-critical, riddled with guilt and paranoia. The
     awareness should have peaceful kindness, as its own part of the mind
     observes the rest of the mind, with a view to improvement. The development
     of this peaceful, relaxed kindness to oneself is one of the key benefits
     emerging from modern "mindfulness" courses.(eeh)</li>
            <li>(eh)*Care* is a general attitude towards
     oneself, towards life and the teachings, through which someone does genuinely
     care about actions (karma) and sincerely wishes to apply the teachings.
     For care to be cultivated, pride and anger need to be overcome and
     devotion and respect need to be developed--towards enlightened beings and
     to all other beings.(eeh)</li>
         </list>
         <paragraph>The
above can also be the more appreciated by thinking of their opposites, being: </paragraph>
         <list kind="ul">
            <li>scatterbrained,
     with no ethical dynamic, driven by feelings and emotions,</li>
            <li>totally
     unaware of what actions are doing to oneself or to other people and the
     world and </li>
            <li>basically
     someone who couldn't care anyway... </li>
         </list>
         <paragraph>The
three skills help and support each other and form a healthy whole. Let us now
consider them one by one.</paragraph>
         <subsection title="Mindfulness" pagetitle="Mindfulness" tocentry="Mindfulness">
            <paragraph>Mindfulness
is a living thing. Like beautiful music or the feel of a warm, breathing animal
in the hands, it cannot be described but needs to be directly experienced. In
order to get the feel of mindfulness, we train in it progressively. At first it
is artificial but, with time, it becomes natural. It
has two aspects--a meditation aspect and a wisdom aspect. The first is the
development of an attentive calm; a living "presence" in the moment.
This usually starts with physical things: mindful walking, mindful eating,
mindfulness of breathing and so forth. When the meditative aspect is familiar,
the light of wisdom needs to be brought in to join it.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)There are four main steps in
mindfulness training: (eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)1.     *Body* - all things physical. (eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)2.     *Feelings*. (eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)3.     One's own *mind*.(eeh)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>(eh)4.     *Phenomena* in general.(eeh)</paragraph>
            <subsubsection title="1.  Mindfulness of Body.  " pagetitle="1.  Mindfulness of Body.  "
                           tocentry="1.  Mindfulness of Body.  ">
               <paragraph>Remember:
_mindfulness_ means _recollection_! Mindfulness of body is where many
people start: often with walking meditation, so let's take that as an example.
The object is to keep mind (awareness in a very general sense, not in the
specific sense described above) with the body. At first the mind finds it hard
to remain with the sensations of the feet: it run away here and there,
remembering things of the past, imagining the future or just flitting around
like a butterfly from one thought or idea to the next.  By repeatedly bring it
back to, and anchoring it to, the sensations in the feet, one trains in
mindfulness and of developing recollection. Each
time there is _distraction_ and the mind flies away in its reveries, one
has _forgotten_ the intention: to keep the mind with the body. Only when
one realises that attention has wandered can the _recollection_ be
re-established. With time, the distractions become fewer and
shorter-lasting and the calm joy and actual feel of mindful presence can be
experienced. In this process, as a spin-off, one gains more objectivity about the
habit-patterns of one's own mind, although that sort of naturally-occurring psycho-analysis
is not the main point.    </paragraph>
               <paragraph>One
then extends this type of training to other physical activities, such as
eating. The important thing is to persist
assiduously during the practice session until the feel and joy of mindfulness
is appreciated. The next step is not to lose the benefit the moment that the meditation
session is over. A lot of the day is spent walking, even if it be from
one room to another. All walking can become mindful, as can all eating and,
with time, most physical activities. Without becoming lost in the sensorial, a
whole new physical relationship with material reality emerges: a feeling of
being awake, alive and in the present; breathing each breath as a new person
and moving through a world of awakened odours, flavours and tactile sensations.
More than that, the meaning of "presence of mind" becomes vivid. One
gains a new awareness of: </paragraph>
               <list kind="ul">
                  <li>One's
     own body and physical functions. </li>
                  <li>Of
     the body's inter-relation with other people's bodies and </li>
                  <li>The
     "body" of the surrounding world, the environment. </li>
               </list>
               <paragraph>At this stage, meditation needs to be enhanced by the
light of wisdom: +then there will be true mindfulness rather than simply peaceful
awareness+.
This is done by understanding the Buddha's teachings about the body and by testing
their veracity--not in one's intellect or through pre-formed opinions but in the
actual reality of mindful experience. </paragraph>
               <paragraph>In
particular, one considers habitual *illusions of beauty and ugliness, of
permanence, of purity and desirability* and so forth, recognising the power
of these illusions over ourselves and other people, making things attractive or
repulsive and sometimes making those things seem longer-lasting than they
naturally are. This could be applied to sexual attraction, which is one of the
most powerful factors in many lives. It could also be applied to the time,
effort and money spent making the home a "beautiful" place, a
pleasant place, or in making the body beautiful. </paragraph>
               <paragraph>In
Buddhist India, in order to counteract a romanticising of bodies, monks and
nuns would go to meditate in charnel grounds--places where dead bodies were left
to be eaten by the birds and jackals. There, they would contemplate the various
exposed components of a body, especially the thirty-six *impure*
substances (see annexe and mindfulness sutra).  Their objective was not to
persuade themselves into a different illusion (Buddhist illusion) but to unveil,
to witness, the truth: simple, uncom-promising and unassuming vivid knowledge
of what physicality really is. </paragraph>
               <paragraph>_Comment by several contemporary lamas: These days, in
"highly-developed" countries, there are of course no charnel grounds
and it becomes increasingly rare to even see a dead body. In hiding away old
age and death, our civilisations plunge themselves deeper into illusion and
deprive themselves of a natural understanding of the truth of ageing and
mortality. The fact that those who _have_ nursed the dying often say, _It
was such a privilege _shows us the rarity of the experience. It is so
different from former times in Europe and present times in villages in
underdeveloped countries, where old age and dying are a natural part of
everyday existence and in which everyone participates. _End of comment_</paragraph>
               <paragraph>By
understanding bodies for what they are, and material goods for what they are,
rather than the illusions which we spin or others spin around them, we
understand better our own processes of clinging and involvement with them and
the karma that these pull us into. This leads us into the next step. </paragraph>
            </subsubsection>
            <subsubsection title="2.   Mindfulness of Feelings" pagetitle="2.   Mindfulness of Feelings"
                           tocentry="2.   Mindfulness of Feelings">
               <paragraph>"Feelings"
is a very loose term in English, covering physical sensations, emotions and
even opinions: _What do you feel about proportional ballots? I feel lonely.._.
It has been used universally to translate the
Sanskrit dharma term _vedanā_, which is, on the contrary,
something very limited and precisely-defined. There are only three vedana: _feels
good, feels bad_ and _neutral (no feeling)_. These can be stretched to five:
physically pleasant, mentally pleasant, physically unpleasant, mentally
unpleasant and neutral. </paragraph>
               <paragraph>Thus the new skill of mindfulness, developed with
physical things, now becomes awareness of mind's instant reaction to sense
experiences. In the very instant following seeing something, or smelling it,
hearing it etc., there will be this immediate, reactive "feeling" of
pleasantness or unpleasantness or else there will be no feeling at all. In the instant following
the feeling, the feeling is given voice in the mind's inner chatter: _This
colour is ugly!, Oh, gosh that's soft! What delicious plums! Horrible noise!_
etc. Although the latter are primarily thoughts, they reveal the feelings that
preceded them and they testify to the power and nature of those feelings. </paragraph>
               <paragraph>The
quest for the pleasant and the fleeing of the unpleasant dominates life and is
the motor force behind actions.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>Humans
find excrement repulsive: dogs are quite attracted to it. "One man's meat
is another man's poison."  Some people like hot climates. Others prefer
the cold. Some people become excited by certain, natural body odours, others
find them repulsive. </paragraph>
               <paragraph>It is very useful to become mindful of one's own
habitual feelings, as described above. Just as, in the early training, one
maintained awareness with the sensations in the feet, here one maintains
awareness with the ever-changing feelings provoked by sights and sounds. Once
there is mindfulness of feelings provoked by data coming in through the five
senses, one turns to feelings provoked by thoughts--by being mindful of how
one's own mind reacts so differently to the thoughts that are none other than
itself, its own creation. Some thoughts engender sheer delight, others trigger
unbearable pain. As one becomes aware of what one's own mind does to itself, in
this respect, the process is seen as quite amazing (and often out of control).</paragraph>
               <paragraph>All the above is the meditative aspect of mindfulness
of feelings. Once mindfulness becomes a familiar companion to feelings, it is
important to develop the wisdom aspect, by understanding the Buddha's teachings
on feelings. In particular, at this point, it is important to come to an
intimate *understanding of suffering*, as the three types of suffering described in Module Two.  These leads one to appreciate that often, what _feels_
good is not necessarily good for us! And what is good for us can feel difficult
or uncomfortable! Mindfulness of feelings is to be aware of their role in one's
own life and of their role in the processes of interdependence in general.  _Feelings_
are important because they trigger _craving_. Craving gives rise to all
the other mind poisons and it is craving which causes one to become involved
with situations and _create karma_, through actions. Being mindful of
this, a factor of _choice_ develops, supplanting habit. The feelings can
be either followed or re-channelled wisely, according to the teachings on
karma.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>The texts describe feelings as being
'like a water-tree'. This is often translated as a plantain or banana tree,
which has no heartwood and is hollow. Some Tibetan lamas take the meaning as
'driftwood', in the sense of something useless while others keep the plantain
meaning but translate the description as meaning 'useless', inasmuch as one
cannot make furniture or build houses with plantain wood. Whichever the case,
feelings are a very vivid example of how the mind makes solid something which
has no existence of its own and which comes and goes and changes in seconds. These
chimeras of feelings dominate life and lead humans into all sorts of actions.</paragraph>

                           tocentry="3.   Mindfulness of Mind">
               <paragraph>(eh)Mindfulness of feelings starts to make
us more aware of our mind's constructs around those feelings and in particular
the thoughts of "I". First, the meditative aspect of _mindfulness
of mind_ is cultivated, by placing quiet awareness with one's thoughts and
mental activity, just as one did with the soles of the feet in walking meditation.
Here, one is being mindful of mind, mind the observer; mind, the experiencer;
mind, the subject as opposed to other people and things; mind that usually
feels like "me".(eeh)</paragraph>
               <paragraph>When there is meditative familiarity with the
subjective mind, one needs then to cultivate the wisdom aspect of _mindfulness
of mind._We
will use parts of a traditional teaching from the great Jamgon Kongtrul
Rinpoche as a basis for explaining this.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>Thus
far, mindfulness has been focussed on body and feelings. These correspond to
the first two of the five aggregates.</paragraph>

               <paragraph>(eh)The notion of self--the way
one thinks of oneself or of another person--is based upon the person's mind.
What it is commonly considered to continue from one life to the next is mind,
since the five senses depend upon the body and cease at death. Mind itself is
primarily consciousness, an ability to know, a clarity or spaciousness that
allows experiences to happen within it. *Therefore mindfulness of +mind+
is focussed on _consciousness_, the fifth aggregate. *(eeh)</paragraph>
               <paragraph>(eh)Some Buddhist traditions
only talk about the six consciousnesses. In that case, mind is the sixth of the
consciousnesses. In the traditions that discuss consciousness as eightfold,

consciousness'. (eeh)</paragraph>
               <paragraph>Whichever system
one uses, mind is observed meticulously. It is discovered to be *impermanent*. Mind is different from one
life to the next, from one decade to the next, from one year to the next and so
on. Even the mind of one shortest instant of awareness is different from the
next one. No lasting thing can be found that
we could call "mind". But still we entertain the idea of a lasting
mind, a lasting self, even though it is never found. We entertain a total
illusion. That illusion dominates life. Thus we need to examine it again
and again to reverse our mistaken habits.</paragraph>

Belief in a personality, a self, lies at the root of our actions which cause
the suffering of this and future lives. Most Buddhists--who technically do not
hold the view of a personal self as truly existing--mostly act, in their daily
lives, as though they did believe in a self. It is very helpful to reflect upon
such glaring contradictions between our beliefs and our actions.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>Aryadeva
says</paragraph>
               <paragraph>_Believing in a stream, one believes in
a lasting self_</paragraph>
               <paragraph>_Believing in skandhas (as one), one
believes things to truly exist. _</paragraph>
               <paragraph>Thus people
believe the skandhas to be lasting and take one or more of them for a "self".
By mindfulness of mind, one witnesses the truth of what the skandhas really
are, and discovers them to be non-lasting and not to have a single entity.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>The above is an investigation of the
ultimate nature of mind. The most refined form of such investigation is found
in the traditions based on the teachings of _prajnaparamita_, the
perfection of wisdom teachings from Nagarjuna.</paragraph>
               <paragraph>On a relative level, it is by long-term,
observation of mind that we come to understand directly and intuitively how the
successive instants of consciousness relate to and trigger each other. It
becomes clear how habits are formed and how they repeat themselves, from year
to year, from life to life; how they can be weakened and how they can be
strengthened. </paragraph>
               <paragraph>The best outcome
of developing mindfulness of mind is to understand the continuity of the stream
of consciousness from life to life, without falling into the 'extremes' of
permanence (believing in a lasting self that is reborn) or nihilism (dismissing relative
reality, cause and effect, reincarnation etc. through a misunderstanding of
voidness).  The IIIrd Gyalwang Karmapa says:</paragraph>
               <paragraph>_It is not something which exists: even
the Enlightened Ones have not seen it._</paragraph>
               <paragraph>_It is not something which does not
exist; it's the basis for all of samsara and nirvana._</paragraph>
               <paragraph>_There is no contradiction in this but
the two-in-union Middle Way._</paragraph>
               <paragraph>_May the very nature of mind, free of
these extremes, be realised._</paragraph>

               <paragraph>This
is the most subtle step of mindfulness, as it is to remain mindful of the very
nature of things. One way of expressing this would be _the unity of interdependence
and voidness_. In a limited interpretation of this point, the objects of
mindfulness are _dharmas_. Just as shapes and colours are the objects of
visual consciousness, _dharmas_ are whatever the subjective mind can be
conscious of. These can be ideas, memories, imaginary situations, a
mathematical puzzle etc. etc.  The wider understanding of the term _dharmas_
is of the vary nature of all things--the whole of the Buddha's teachings being
precisely about that. Let us consider some points emerging from Kongtrul's
teachings on this. Concerning the meditative aspect:</paragraph>
               <paragraph>(eh)"Here we turn our
attention to the third and fourth aggregates. (eeh)</paragraph>
               <paragraph>The
third aggregate is *cognition*, the way in which the mind recognises and
labels things. Based on all the references we carry in our minds, complex
notions of reality develop and these colour the whole tonality of our life
experience. </paragraph>
               <paragraph>The
fourth aggregate is very global. In fact, in one way, it contains all the
others. It is called *mental events* or *karmic formations *(Skt:
samskara) Fifty-one important ones are given. They become fifty-six when
erroneous views (no. 26) is expanded into the five misconceptions. </paragraph>
               <paragraph>Furthermore,
this fourth skandha also includes various lists (often twenty-four are
mentioned) of abstract concepts which also play an important part in our lives.
Examples of those would be notions like _loss_ or _gain_, or of
things being _similar_ to each other.</paragraph>

               <paragraph>The wisdom aspect and the reason why we turn our
mindfulness to cognition and the samskaras is in order *to understand quite
what is happening with rebirth*. There are many aspects to this, summed up in these
bullet-points but not developed here in detail:</paragraph>
               <list kind="ul">
                  <li>Each
     notion and each mental event has its own nature. The 'mind' is +not one
     thing+, like an actor wearing many masks, but an +endless series of
     different flashes of experience, the previous one triggering the next+.
     We call this the 'mind stream'. The stream is not a thing in itself, just
     as a mountain stream is no more than the drops of water of which it is
     composed. </li>
                  <li>Just
     as one moment of mind triggers, and leads to, another moment of mind in
     this life, so also does that stream of consciousness continue after death,
     carrying its imprints (programming) into the next life.</li>
                  <li>The
     mind of the past shapes the mind of the future and there is an infallible
     rule that virtue always leads to happiness and non-virtue always leads to
     suffering. One could say this good karma-bad karma conditioning in
     consciousness is like either gold dust or pollution being carried with the
     stream.</li>
                  <li>"Cause
     and effect" is more subtle than it first appears. On needs to
     contemplate deeply what the Buddha intended, in the Rice Shoot Sutra, when
     he said that, "Because there is this, that arises".  He did not
     say, "This creates that". We do this through exploring the
     twelve links of interdependence through three aspects: invariability,
     impermanence and karmic programming. In the process, we apply the voidness
     teachings of the perfection of wisdom.</li>
                  <li>Sentient
     beings are highly complex, changing streams of results created by actions
     in the past. What they are doing now, through each of their complex
     personalities, is shaping the future.</li>
               </list>
               <paragraph>By
becoming mindful of the reality of the above points--as moment after moment this
or that skandha manifests and disappears--a heightened sensitivity develops to
the actual nature and power of actions, and to the motivation which underpins action.
Life processes become illuminated by wisdom. Long-held illusions--the myths of
reality, of future possibilities, of luck, of God and so forth--evaporate in the
morning sunlight of truth. Great compassion arises for our fellow sentient
beings lost in confusion.</paragraph>

         <subsection title="Awareness" pagetitle="Awareness" tocentry="Awareness">
            <paragraph>The
development of mindfulness, described above, relies on being aware, from a beginner's
general awareness of physical sensations through to an experienced Buddhist's  subtle
awareness of interdependence at play. The awareness we will explore in this
section is called _samprajanyam_ in Sanskrit. In this context, it means _cultivating
vigilance_. It is a process of self-awareness that checks that all is going
as it should. Although far from perfect as an example, a good modern metaphor
for this would be the security camera, constantly watching to make sure there
is no danger, or signalling the danger when it happens so that something can be
done. A good point about this example is that a camera is unemotional,
non-judgemental. It just gives an image of what is happening. _Samprajanyam_
is a high-quality mind camera that gives an excellent view of what is happening
each second. What is then done about it is very much the next topic, _care_.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In
vajrayana Buddhism, we have a special way of getting the right feel of such
awareness, in practices where, one way or another, the Buddha or guru is
constantly present. The "feel" of this checking awareness should be
that of the peaceful, benevolent wisdom of the Buddha. As we know that the
Buddha is the true essence of our being, there is no internal conflict, no
splitting oneself into two. It is simply
the wiser part of the mind observing the old habits of the less-wise part. In
applying this, we discover the meaning of _compassion for oneself_.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The
_mahamudra_ system of meditation has many skilful and subtle techniques
for helping to deepen and stabilise _awareness, _ this insightful part of
one's mind. First, there needs to be a healthy basis of peaceful stability (_samatta_). 
Then the peaceful mind can be used to know itself more profoundly. This opens
up many unexpected doors of insight and a quality of awareness never before
experienced. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Simply being very aware is not necessarily in itself virtuous.
One could be vividly aware yet doing horrible things and enjoying them.
Therefore, the essential characteristic of this Buddhist awareness is to be
aware of whether or not one is being mindful of sacred purpose. Put another way, it is
helping us to live to our highest ethical standards and not "turn a blind
eye" to the more negative habits.</paragraph>
         </subsection>
         <subsection title="Care" pagetitle="Care" tocentry="Care">
            <paragraph>Whereas
mindfulness and awareness are very much things which take place "in the
moment", _care_ is something developed generally, over time. It grows
or weakens from year to year, according to enthusiasm and many other factors.
There is a very famous quotation from Guru Rinpoche<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Keep your view as broad as space</paragraph>
            <paragraph>And your action as fine as flour.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This
is a healthy reminder not to let slip everyday values of human goodness as the
view of voidness and understanding of illusion deepen. The greatest
masters--those who had a "view" as broad as space itself--are famous
for never considering any good thing too trivial to bother doing and never
considering any harmful thing so small it could be ignored: action as fine as
flour.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Care
is usually increased by awareness of how fleeting and precious this human life
is and, by consequence, awareness of death and impermanence. </paragraph>
